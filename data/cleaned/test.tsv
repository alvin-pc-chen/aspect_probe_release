left	STATIVE	Last season it was a fertile veggie bed -- but it was left un-fertilized as an experiment.	54	57
says	DYNAMIC	This is what happens, David says.	28	32
have	STATIVE	You have to keep feeding it organic material, or it turns back into sand.	4	7
been	STATIVE	It's always been this way in North Truro.	12	15
used	STATIVE	There used to be a local tradition in this area: at each spring tide , the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes to harvest the grasses.	6	9
called	STATIVE	"This was called ""salt marsh haying""."	9	14
has	STATIVE	Salt marsh hay has no weed seeds, and it doesn't compact as heavily as other types of hay.	15	17

got	STATIVE	David isn't alone: he's got the support (and companionship) of a growing group of gamechangers.	24	26
start	DYNAMIC	If, someone could start bedding the outer cape's horses, with this Hay/Straw.	18	22
make	DYNAMIC	This would also, make it more profitable.	17	20
have	STATIVE	They wouldn't have to be standing on the acidic sand all of the time.	14	17
used	DYNAMIC	The straw/hay could also be a form of supplemental food, for livestock/horses, which has been used in before times.	94	97
separated	DYNAMIC	The straw, should be separated from the manure and dried in the air, then buised, by hooves.	21	29
intended	DYNAMIC	These characters are like Zombies (pun intended), they just keep coming back to life.	39	48
think	STATIVE	"I don't think you can ""get off"" any of these, you have to triangulate your decision across several nodes of popular culture, a triangulation that has to revolve around the audience (young adult -- Twilght."	8	12
work	DYNAMIC	So what sort of matrix board do you have to create to know that a NC-17 comedy horror Zombie video game will work, but a PG-13 young adult time-travelling Vampire TV show won't?	109	113
think	STATIVE	If you broaden your scope a bit, I think it would be difficult to find a time over the last 40 years or so when any of these four archetypes didn't have a level of bubbling popularity via books, comic books, tv, movies, video games, music.	35	39
comes	DYNAMIC	Publishers, producers, editors, TV execs, they all have to calibrate their decisions based on so many factors, and yet even with access to sophisticated data it often comes down to human factors.	167	171
says	STATIVE	Somebody at AMC is greenlighting The Walking Dead based partly on historical evidence that says people like Zombies, but also partly on the notion that this particular iteration will have a new twist that will bring new people into the (zombie and AMC) tent .	91	94
make	DYNAMIC	Hey, if they can make Aliens and Cowboys , anything is possible.	17	20
inspired	DYNAMIC	This post was inspired by a recent post by Grant McCracken .	14	21
says	DYNAMIC	Matthew Duhan says: July 26, 2010 at 5:13 pm	14	18
play	DYNAMIC	I don't know about Pirate Zombies v. Ninja Vampires, but there is a game where you can play to become Zombies, Ninjas, Pirates, and Mad Scientists.	87	90
find	DYNAMIC	You can find more information on our website.	8	11
add	DYNAMIC	We do have an expansion planned, which will add Vampires (among other Types) to the mix.	44	46
performed	STATIVE	Incredibly effectively performed without a doubt.	23	31
sit	STATIVE	I could sit and watch all day long if I didn't have school..or life to stay me from doing it!	8	10
consider	DYNAMIC	If you want to have a model for large or extendible characters, I would like to suggest that we consider (again) the model of TeX and the Computer Modern fonts.	96	103
done	DYNAMIC	Barbara Beeton of the AMS has also done interesting work on math font layout in some ISO workgroup.	35	38
include	DYNAMIC	Between =-=-=-= lines I'll include a piece I wrote about that in relation to the Elsevier Science DTD's.	27	33
including	STATIVE	A generic mechanism for counters, including some rules for presentation of counters, is as follows.	34	42
start	STATIVE	- All top-level counters start at the value 0 (zero) at the beginning of the document.	25	29
numbered	DYNAMIC	- If the |id| attribute is missing, the counter is not incremented, and the element is not numbered.	91	99
referenced	DYNAMIC	This means that tables and figures always have an |id| attribute even when they are not referenced.	88	98
numbered	STATIVE	(Or are there also cases where tables and figures are not numbered?)	58	67
described	STATIVE	There are (at least) the following exceptions to the algorithm described above:	63	71
form	STATIVE	The contents of a figure form one (physical) entity, but inspection of the contents show that there are logical sub-figures (hidden) inside the figure.	25	28
interrupted	DYNAMIC	Numbering in lists, or sub-numbering in equations, is interrupted.	54	65
continues	STATIVE	Example: a numbered list with items 1, 2, 3, is followed by a paragraph of text (the || is on the same level as the |<l>|), and then the list continues 4, 5, 6.	142	150
interrupted	STATIVE	The intention of the author appears to be {\em one\/} list, but this list is interrupted.	77	88
occur	DYNAMIC	When a figure (as far as we know, hidden sub-components occur only with figures.)	56	60
enables	STATIVE	This enables generation of the labels of the sub-figures.	5	11
represented	STATIVE	where the counter strings (4 1) and (4 2) are represented as `4a' and `4b' (but this presentation is application-dependent of course).	46	56
identify	STATIVE	the picture in |fig4| contains two labels, `a' and `b', that identify sub-figures.	61	68
referenced	STATIVE	Both the figure as a whole and the individual sub-figures are referenced.	62	72
add	DYNAMIC	"If we add an attribute to the start tag we can achieve this: |<fig id=fig4 comp=""a b""^gt;|."	6	8
suggests	STATIVE	"Unfortunately, the attribute |comp=""a b""| also suggests a presentation."	47	54
refer	STATIVE	where |4|, |(4 1)and |(4 2) refer to the same object (physical figure) in the document instance.	28	32
stands	STATIVE	where |eq$1is the unique |id assigned to equation~(1'), and |label(eq1)| stands for the label of the equation with id=eq1.	73	78
look	STATIVE	(Lists look like a special case of nesting: numbering of list items normally starts with 1, but every list item must have an \verb|id| that is unique within the document.	7	10
numbered	DYNAMIC	This could be achieved if we also numbered the parent element \verb|<l^gt;|.)	34	41
numbered	DYNAMIC	and the author has numbered the list items as 1, 2, 3, 4.	19	26
agreed	DYNAMIC	We agreed earlier that one of the guiding principles is to follow the author unless there are errors in the manuscript.	3	8
intended	STATIVE	HTML-Math is intended to allow ... as well as rendering to graphical bitmapped displays.	13	20
use	DYNAMIC	This is the documentation of our article DTD, and it contains tables with *all* symbols and characters we use in typesetting our products.	106	108
make	DYNAMIC	Elsevier Science is in discussion with several societies about the possibility of completing a font set that covers all this, and perhaps more, and make it freely available.	148	151
used	DYNAMIC	This is used in chemical formulas, and is different from an arrow or brace AS ORNAMENT, that adjusts its width to the text underneath it.	8	11
occur	STATIVE	In example 2 a lot of reserved words occur: from, to, of.	37	42
see	DYNAMIC	I did not see anything wrong in Bruce's description --all I was trying to do was to fill in the gaps in the description as I perceived --	10	12
see	DYNAMIC	The meeting discussed Bruce's new proposal, see:	44	47
allowed	STATIVE	o Whether the character is allowed as the first or subsequent characters in an identifier.	27	33
wanted	STATIVE	Bruce said he wanted to avoid potential naming conflicts with other groups wishing to define new HTML tags.	14	19
makes	DYNAMIC	Neil explained that this makes it much easier to write the line breaking algorithm.	25	29
make	DYNAMIC	The features needed for math make it inappropriate to use the HTML table tags.	29	32
suggests	DYNAMIC	The current inability to call the browser to handle such nested tags suggests we need to take a cautious approach.	69	76
used	DYNAMIC	How can CSS based style sheets influence the style properties used within plugins?	62	65
made	DYNAMIC	Action: Neil to investigate Netscape Navigator 3.0 plug-in SDK to see what improvements have been made to the api.	98	101
occur	DYNAMIC	One short term solution would be to add parameters to the math tags to specify the context in which the elements occur, e.g.	113	118
allow	DYNAMIC	The control panel for the html-math plug-in would allow the user to set the font size to be used in these contexts.	50	54
supported	STATIVE	This could be supported via SGML tags and attributes.	14	22
allow	STATIVE	Also, this will allow us to handle complex expressions appearing as embellishments to other complex expressions correctly.	16	20
works	DYNAMIC	Mathematica's parsing, which works in a manner similar to what Bruce describes, has no problem handling complex embellishments as in your example.	29	33
see	DYNAMIC	Perhaps I am too familar with the algorithm and that I filled in pieces missing in Bruce's description, but I didn't see anything wrong with his description.	117	119
made	DYNAMIC	Fibonacci's formula instead of equation 1.13 --this made listening to cross-referenced material easier.	52	55
performed	DYNAMIC	AsTeR also performed the other kind of sub-expression naming which I think got discussed yesterday during the meeting.	11	19
implemented	STATIVE	"--""folding"" to use Dave's terminology-- AsTeR also implemented a fairly straight-forward naming algorithm for giving meaningful names to sub-expressions e.g."	51	61
suspect	STATIVE	"However, even without the intelligence to recognize two semantically equivalent instances of a subexpression, ""variable substitution"" or ""folding"" as Dave refers to it in his minutes is *really* useful for speech and I suspect it would be very useful for small visual displays."	219	225
had	DYNAMIC	In fact after I implemented the variable substitution in AsTeR Rich Zippel at Cornell pointed out that symbolic math systems in the early 70's had to implement something analogous to display complex expressions since the displays available at the time were not as graphically rich as what we have today.	143	145
agree	STATIVE	"I agree with Ron Whitney, and should have said so before, that the effort that has gone into this proposal is substantial, and this is really concrete stuff we can ""chew on""."	2	6
see	STATIVE	I also see that extensible languages are hard to realize within the possibilities of the SGML language.	7	9
written	DYNAMIC	I certainly support the use of ISO TR 9573 entity names for mathematical and technical symbols, as I have written earlier.	106	112
follow	STATIVE	My own perceptions of this committee's work to date follow.	52	58
look	DYNAMIC	While the immediate goal of an HTML-Math capability might have been to simply render math visually (and perhaps this was the goal of HTML-Math 3), that goal has been considerably expanded as we look at issues now.	194	197
give	DYNAMIC	I was hoping, and still do, that formal support such as this would give a direct means of filtering ISO 12083 math into HTML-math.	67	70
gives	STATIVE	Support in this way gives strong acknowledgement to prior SGML work.	20	24
found	DYNAMIC	While Stephen himself broadcasts at a very powerful wattage, I've found the committee members from WRI quite accommodating and undogmatic.	66	70
wanted	STATIVE	I asked the question because I wanted to know how feasible the mechanisms are that Bruce describes.	31	36
agree	STATIVE	I agree with Ron that there is some politics involved as well.	2	6
got	DYNAMIC	As an aside: at the SGML Europe'96 conference Roy Pike attended the meeting of the committee responsible for ISO 12083, chaired by Eric van Herwijnen, and we got him to consent to the idea that there will always be users who need/insist on a P(resentation) (geometric, visual) notation.	158	160
placed	STATIVE	This is enough to allow anchor's within math, and math in text in math, with the burden placed on the plugin.	88	93
is	DYNAMIC	It is just when you try to embellish an operator.	3	4
works	DYNAMIC	"Since the details of why a prefix embellishing operator sometimes ""works"" right and sometimes doesn't are probably beyond most authors, I think we should avoid them."	66	72
act	DYNAMIC	with the information that &big can act as a prefix embellishment operator this yields:	35	37
act	DYNAMIC	If each operator has a property indicating that it can act as an embellishment on other operators, then we can use this fact to make the above parse as	55	57
defined	STATIVE	In essence we sort the operator precedence reduction rules into a sequence that resolves potential ambiguities between different operator roles defined by the dictionary for each symbol.	144	150
including	STATIVE	You have already asserted that people are comfortable with dictionary definitions for the roles of symbols as prefix, infix or postfix operators (including their precedences).	145	154
appeared	DYNAMIC	Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband.	34	41
took	DYNAMIC	She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance”.	4	7
refers	STATIVE	It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness.	3	8
finds	DYNAMIC	Toyoo, her human lover in “Lust of the White Serpant” cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself “disturbed and agitated” by her “ethereal beauty”.	128	132
follows	DYNAMIC	In “Eternal Prisoner,” Madame White Snake’s bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning “he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.” “Eternal Prisoner under the Thunder Peak Pagoda.” Trans.	62	68
fills	STATIVE	In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes “Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine’s characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not”.	286	290
serve	STATIVE	The complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories.	35	39
comes	DYNAMIC	In both stories, Madame White Snake’s secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her, and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda.	69	73
took	DYNAMIC	In “Lust,” the priest informs Toyoo “Those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you.	53	56
depicted	STATIVE	If they were, Madame White Snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character.	55	62
leaves	DYNAMIC	she gushes to him in “Lust.” Readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her.	119	124
take	STATIVE	Please, since we are already married, take me back, and let’s stay together the rest of our lives.	38	41
made	DYNAMIC	” the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover, and suffers for it, suggesting that traditionally, loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the man’s part as well as a woman’s.	43	46
enjoyed	DYNAMIC	Readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty, and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat.	131	137
argues	DYNAMIC	In an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir, Janey Place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end.	67	72
enjoyed	DYNAMIC	This resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints, since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories.	144	150
announced	DYNAMIC	On that date Jennings Lambeth, president of Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company, announced that most of the steel company’s Campbell Works would close.	79	87
had	STATIVE	Mahoning County was a one-industry area, and the people of Youngstown, Struthers, Campbell, Boardman Township, and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer: the steel mills.	176	178
had	STATIVE	Petitions, protests, rallies, collectivization, and even the takeover of a steel company’s headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had.	229	232
identify	DYNAMIC	When examining the area’s history, culture, and economic situation we can identify four main reasons: the refusal of the international leadership of United Steelworkers of America to support their union’s Youngstown branch, the lagging international steel market, the lack of a clear, organized vision for individual initiatives such as the Save Our Valley Campaign, and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region, all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry.	74	81
affected	DYNAMIC	Although it affected Youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions, the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level.	12	19
played	DYNAMIC	During the Civil War, Youngstown played a vital role in supplying the Union army with iron products.	33	38
continued	DYNAMIC	The town continued to prosper, driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills.	9	17
continued	STATIVE	This prosperity continued until the late 1920s, when the Great Depression hit the area hard.	16	24
made	DYNAMIC	Finally, the outbreak of the Second World War made iron and steel important again, and Youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fast-paced period of booming growth.	46	49
making	DYNAMIC	At the same time, stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market American steel parts, and the overeager shareholders in the companies’ stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie.	117	122
send	DYNAMIC	The announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral, which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin.	105	108
closed	DYNAMIC	Between 1977 and 1981, a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25,000 jobs were lost countywide.	50	55
set	DYNAMIC	Meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement.	59	61
sought	DYNAMIC	Without the mills, people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country.	26	31
did	DYNAMIC	Those that could afford to move did so; those that couldn’t afford to move mostly ended up on the streets.	32	34
needed	STATIVE	The workers decided they needed to do something to save their city, and so they mobilized in a variety of ways.	25	30
given	DYNAMIC	The petition was circulated, eventually including thousands of signatures; it was then given to USWA representatives to present to President Carter in Washington.	87	91
had	STATIVE	The International chapter of the USWA had much more lobbying power, but they refused to support the local union members.	38	40
turned	DYNAMIC	Lykes ignored the letters, so the Coalition turned once again to the federal government.	44	49
following	DYNAMIC	Finally, following the shutdown of US Steel’s plant in 1980, local union leaders congregated outside the US Steel Headquarters in Youngstown.	9	17
took	DYNAMIC	They invited local people and politicians to witness the scene, then charged the Headquarters and took it over.	98	101
stayed	DYNAMIC	The workers stayed there until the next day, when US Steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill.	12	17
made	DYNAMIC	These attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors, including the decline of the world steel market, which made American steel impossible to sell or export.	128	131
drew	STATIVE	Also, international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor.	32	35
affected	DYNAMIC	Steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline, and it affected both domestic and foreign companies.	56	63
suggests	STATIVE	As the name suggests, local leaders wanted to instill the people of Youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency, driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region.	12	20
employed	DYNAMIC	Marches, speeches, and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the Campaign and rally the people.	47	54
had	STATIVE	College tuition, clothes, food, and heating all had to come before donations to non-profit organizations.	48	50
had	STATIVE	People outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills, and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds.	27	29
proved	STATIVE	The lack of money proved to be crippling, because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively.	18	23
do	DYNAMIC	Without funds, the Save Our Valley Campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the city’s dying economy.	50	51
seemed	STATIVE	No one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems.	7	12
did	DYNAMIC	Letters and petitions were all very well, but they did little to improve the situation.	51	53
proceed	DYNAMIC	Beyond that, no one knew how they should proceed: everyone knew that saving the mills was important, but nobody stepped forward with a full-fledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down.	41	48
did	DYNAMIC	Without funds to drive the efforts, or even a real plan of action, the Save Our Valley Campaign did more harm than good.	96	98
did	DYNAMIC	People became excited and waited for the mills to reappear, but they never did.	75	78
representing	STATIVE	United Steel Workers of America was the union representing the Youngstown steel workers when the closings hit.	46	57
had	STATIVE	Besides incompetence, the USWA had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart: fear of socialism.	31	33
see	DYNAMIC	Obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action, but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of Youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism.	114	116
supported	DYNAMIC	If the USWA supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories, then the government (and potentially other important people and institutions as well) might begin to think that the UWSA leaders were encouraging socialism.	12	20
mean	STATIVE	This would mean that UWSA would lose credibility with the American government and its people, something they could not afford to do.	11	14
making	STATIVE	People from each town work, shop, eat, and socialize in towns separate from their own, making each town strongly dependent on every other town.	87	92
finds	STATIVE	Two blocks over one finds Boardman, a well-off township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools.	20	24
takes	DYNAMIC	Oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred, with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others.	28	32
agree	DYNAMIC	In some instances, small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area, but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate.	175	179
look	STATIVE	You look exhausted,?	4	7
spoke	DYNAMIC	she spoke again.	4	8
got	STATIVE	"I've got a hotel room up at the Montier.""?"	5	7

looking	DYNAMIC	he suggested, looking around warily.	14	20
reached	DYNAMIC	They reached the Hotel building, but instead stepped into the side alley to reappear.	5	11
appeared	DYNAMIC	They appeared behind a dumpster and stepped out into the street, and then inside Montier Hotel, greeting the warmth happily.	5	12

spoke	DYNAMIC	Melody walked up to the counter and spoke quietly to Mr. Greyhem.	36	40

worked	STATIVE	At his home lab in Sussex, he worked on a new experiment based on his thesis.	30	35
called	DYNAMIC	It functioned like a Spinning Wheel, twisting fibers of time space and folding them on a molecular level to create what he called “Newmatter.”	123	128

stood	DYNAMIC	I stood and ran briskly across the field to the road.	2	6
having	DYNAMIC	As a child, I had been terrified of the caravan, partly because the Bonesetter growled and snapped at the village children, but also because of the blood-curdling screams that came from inside when people were having their broken bones set, so they would heal properly.	210	215
kept	DYNAMIC	I knew that the Bonesetter would not answer unless it was an emergency, so I kept knocking until he opened the door and snarled, “What is it you want that you must make such a racket on my door?” “You must come,” I said, gasping.	77	80

find	DYNAMIC	“Gianna said she couldn’t find you.”	26	29

going	DYNAMIC	My first thought: I was going crazy.	24	28

found	DYNAMIC	I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was found.	79	84

looked	STATIVE	They all looked the same: clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt, the hangers-on, the circle with whom the gossip was shared.	9	14
wondered	DYNAMIC	I wondered at the ship instead.	2	9
got	DYNAMIC	How they were all powered was a mystery—as good as the technology got, a quality robot like that was still an energy sink.	66	69
had	DYNAMIC	It was the brain, mostly; the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources.	64	66
be	DYNAMIC	Sarah's crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled, all seemingly pleased to have a new set of ears to talk at.	65	66
modeled	STATIVE	I would attend afternoon dance classes, so that when the evening dances came around (modeled after the historical social gatherings of several hundred years prior), I would be less of an embarrassment to myself.	84	91
start	DYNAMIC	I told myself that tonight, the observation period would end and I'd start puzzling out the ship's mystery.	69	73
smothered	DYNAMIC	I smothered thoughts of friends back on Earth—this was my long-awaited vacation, my clean break and my temporary retreat; I'd try contacting those friends tomorrow.	2	10
tucked	DYNAMIC	I continued to care little for shipwide gossip, but our discussions of films and flicks, old and new, brought out my artistic, story-loving, argumentative side, a side of me I'd tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer.	178	183
had	DYNAMIC	Maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life, hitting some threshold or some breaking point.	9	11

was	DYNAMIC	I assumed he was indisposed.” Kishori nodded in agreement.	13	15

cut	DYNAMIC	I cut in.	2	4
looked	STATIVE	Sarah looked indignant.	6	11
offered	DYNAMIC	No one offered a different answer.	7	13
thinking	STATIVE	From the looks on my companions' faces, I knew they were thinking the same.	57	64

see	STATIVE	I guess I didn't see the point.”	17	19
spoke	DYNAMIC	Tiffany nodded, but Kishori spoke before the other woman could.	28	32
went	DYNAMIC	Or where he went.”	12	17
looked	STATIVE	Zheng looked thoughtful.	6	11
set	DYNAMIC	He picked up his glass, swirled the liquid around, took a sip, then set the glass back down.	68	70
addressed	DYNAMIC	Zheng, he addressed me again, leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense, steady gaze.	10	18
sat	STATIVE	I sat sideways in the armchair, feet dangling over one arm, neck resting against the other, absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as I ruminated on the situation.	2	4
proved	DYNAMIC	The lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful.	20	25
allowing	STATIVE	A menu of display options, allowing me to customize all the lightscreen's superficial characteristics.	27	34

held	DYNAMIC	He held me in his arms until I stopped flailing.	3	6
provides	STATIVE	SUMMARY This report provides an analysis of the United States Postal Service's current legal authority to: (1) introduce and provide new products and services; and (2) enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers.	20	27
arranged	DYNAMIC	"• Negotiated Service Agreements (NSAs) or ""niche classifications"" are rate and service adjustments arranged by the Postal Service and potential users that are legally permissible, provided that:"	99	106
directed	DYNAMIC	BACKGROUND AND SCOPE OF ANALYSIS In joint deliberations on appropriations for the United States Postal Service and certain other agencies and departments for Fiscal Year 2002, the committee of conference directed both the Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to prepare reports on particular areas of the Postal Service's authority under existing law.1 Specifically, the conferees directed: …both the United States Postal Service and the Postal Rate Commission to independently report, 90 days after enactment of this Act, on the scope of existing authority of the US Postal Service, under title 39, United States Code, and title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, to introduce and provide new products and services (including the introduction and provision of new products and service on an experimental or market test basis) and to enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups of customers.	204	211
presented	STATIVE	The report is presented in three sections.	14	22
customized	DYNAMIC	Commission proceedings in which the Postal Service has sought to introduce service innovations-some of them customized for particular groups of mailers-on an expedited basis.	108	117
establishes	STATIVE	"Section 101(a) of Title 39 establishes the Postal Service's paramount obligation ""to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the people."""	27	37
serve	STATIVE	The Reorganization Act grants the Postal Service specific powers that serve as the operational tools of service innovation.	70	74
means	DYNAMIC	Section 404 of Title 39 grants the Postal Service plenary authority over custody of the mail and its movement [§ 404(a)(1)]; over the deployment of post offices, other facilities, and equipment [§ 404(a)(3)]; and over the means by which stamps and other postage are sold [§ 404(a)(4) and (5)].	222	226
published	STATIVE	4 The text of the Domestic Mail Classification Schedule is published as Appendix A to Subpart C of 39 C.F.R.	59	67
required	STATIVE	The rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the Postal Service is required to produce, and by expediting the Commission's procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change.	157	164
intended	STATIVE	The Commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate Postal Service mail classification requests involving proposed new services, or changes in existing services, that were intended to serve as experiments.	228	235
proposed	DYNAMIC	The Commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the Service's petition, and after considering the comments of interested parties, implemented four of the proposed initiatives, albeit in revised form.	60	67
establish	STATIVE	The first set of these new procedural rules, incorporated into the Commission's rules of practice as sections 161 through 166,7 establish expedited procedures for consideration of Postal Service proposed market tests of potential new services.	128	136
provide	STATIVE	"They also streamline public notice and hearing procedures, and provide for issuance of a ""yes or no"" Commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days, consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons."	63	69
considered	STATIVE	MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules.	24	33
called	STATIVE	§§ 3001.171-.176. information called for in the Commission's general rules for mail classification proposals.	30	35
defined	STATIVE	Minor classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee; would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing; and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the Postal Service.	33	39
allow	STATIVE	The rules specify limited required supporting information, allow the Service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data, and also streamline procedural scheduling.	59	63
provide	DYNAMIC	The request should also provide Return on Investment projections, other available financial analyses, and cost, revenue, and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period.	24	30
establish	STATIVE	The rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services.	10	18
adopted	DYNAMIC	The Commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996, to be effective for a period of five years.	15	21
performed	DYNAMIC	For example, the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny, or instead submitted for some form of review by the Postal Rate Commission prior to its effectiveness.	102	110
allowing	STATIVE	These provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the Postal Service must be filed as a request with the Postal Rate Commission, allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the Commission and the Governors of the Postal Service.	156	163
recognized	DYNAMIC	Failure to abide by the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change.12 Negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the Reorganization Act.	71	80
assuming	STATIVE	However, assuming the procedural requirements of Chapter 36 are met, changes negotiated by the Postal Service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards.	9	16
addressed	DYNAMIC	"B. Problematical ""Contract Rates"" In a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late 1980s at the request of a mailer, the Commission addressed the question of the Postal Service's authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of a proposal to recognize ""contract rates."""	132	140
included	STATIVE	RM89-5, included two variants:	8	15
establish	DYNAMIC	The Commission might, after considering cost and other relevant evidence, establish a range of permissible rates for particular subclasses, with the Postal Service and individual mailers free thereafter to negotiate rates within this range; or	74	82
provides	STATIVE	Conclusion: Negotiated rates-unaccompanied by a change in service conditions that provides cost justification-are a problematical approach to introducing additional flexibility into Postal Service business practices.	82	89
Following	STATIVE	"C. Negotiated Service Agreements and Specialized ""Niche Classifications"" Following publication of the report of the joint Postal Service-Postal Rate Commission task force on ratemaking, the Postal Service petitioned the Commission to adopt rules to implement some of the report's recommendations."	73	81
add	STATIVE	"One recommendation included in the Service's petition was adoption of Commission rules for reviewing on an expedited basis ""service agreements with postal customers, varying from the general rate and classifications schedules in ways which add value both for the customer and for the postal system as a whole."	240	242
expressed	DYNAMIC	However, the Commission also expressed a general willingness to address the concept in a subsequent rulemaking.	29	37
adopted	STATIVE	Since then, the Commission has conducted several mail classification proceedings under the other expedited procedures adopted in that rulemaking.	118	124
shown	DYNAMIC	"These procedures have been shown to be well suited to the consideration of ""niche classification"" proposals."	27	31
developed	DYNAMIC	Niche classifications are specialized mail classifications- including reduced, but cost-justified rates or fees-that have been developed by the Postal Service in direct consultation with its customers, to meet the needs and capabilities of a mailer or group of mailers.	127	135
recommended	DYNAMIC	"MC2001-1, the Commission recommended three new worksharing-based discounted Priority Mail categories after negotiating with mailers who were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could reduce the Postal Service's costs.18 Such ""niche classification"" proposals are essentially Negotiated Service Agreements, without any associated legal uncertainties or additional administrative barriers."	25	35
agreed	STATIVE	Conclusion: Rate and service adjustments agreed upon by the Postal Service and mailers are legally authorized if three conditions are satisfied: ❶ The proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding, as the Reorganization Act requires; ❷ The agreed-upon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole; and 15 Docket No.	41	46
made	STATIVE	❸ The negotiated rate-and-service package is made available on the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same conditions of service.	45	48

used	STATIVE	The following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:	29	32
refers	STATIVE	"A common terminology error is to call any young horse a ""colt"", when the term actually only refers to young male horses."	92	97
called	DYNAMIC	A nursing foal is sometimes called a suckling and a foal that has been weaned is called a weanling.	28	33
described	STATIVE	"Thus, a horse described as ""15.2 h"" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of 62 inches (157.5 cm) in height."	14	22
influenced	DYNAMIC	The size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition.	48	57
named	STATIVE	The largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848.	65	69
stood	STATIVE	He stood 21.2 1⁄2 hands (86.5 inches, 220 cm) high and his peak weight was estimated at 1,500 kilograms (3,300 lb).	3	7
affected	STATIVE	The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism.	103	110
drawn	DYNAMIC	The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes.	53	57
consider	STATIVE	Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2 h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height.	90	97
exhibit	DYNAMIC	Ponies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat.	13	19
classified	STATIVE	Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than 30 inches (76 cm), are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.	120	129
seen	STATIVE	"jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Bay (left) and chestnut (sometimes called ""sorrel"") are two of the most common coat colors, seen in almost all breeds."	120	123
classified	DYNAMIC	Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex.	18	27
be	DYNAMIC	Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.	29	30
identified	DYNAMIC	Many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified.	64	74
identify	DYNAMIC	Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits.	26	33
found	STATIVE	Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as graying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.	267	271
are	DYNAMIC	"Horses which have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks ""white"" is usually a middle-aged or older gray."	37	39
defined	STATIVE	"However, there are no ""albino"" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes."	39	45
continues	DYNAMIC	Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care.	76	84
do	STATIVE	Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone.	53	54

followed	DYNAMIC	The modern resurgence of parliamentarism and anti-monarchism began with the temporary overthrow of the English monarchy by the Parliament of England in 1649, followed by the American Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of 1792.	158	165
hold	STATIVE	Monarchies are associated with political or sociocultural hereditary rule, in which monarchs rule for life (although some monarchs do not hold lifetime positions: for example, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong of Malaysia serves a five-year term) and pass the responsibilities and power of the position to their child or another member of their family when they die.	138	141
claims	DYNAMIC	A self-proclaimed monarchy is established when a person claims the monarchy without any historical ties to a previous dynasty.	56	61

divided	DYNAMIC	Explanatory models for the NDE can be divided into several broad categories, including psychological, physiological, and transcendental explanations.	38	44
explains	DYNAMIC	Research from neuroscience explains the NDE in terms of various physiological and psychological factors, while some NDE researchers in the field of near-death studies advocate for a transcendental explanation.	27	34
argues	DYNAMIC	Bruce Greyson argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries.	14	19
experiencing	DYNAMIC	Many common elements have been reported, although the person's interpretation of these events often corresponds with the cultural, philosophical, or religious beliefs of the person experiencing it.	181	192

needed	DYNAMIC	One toddler needed surgery after a pacu (misreported as a piranha) bit her finger at Edinburgh Butterfly and Insect World in Scotland.	12	17
according	STATIVE	Most UK dealers now refuse to stock this species due to the large size and expensive aquarium requirements it demands, according to Practical Fishkeeping magazine's Matt Clarke.	119	127
cut	STATIVE	State wildlife authorities typically advise home aquarists who wish to get rid of overgrown pacu to cut the heads off the fish and dispose of them as garbage.	100	102
allowing	DYNAMIC	We used to fish for the latter variety in the quiet pools while allowing the canoe to drift, and always saved some of the fish as bait for the big fellows.	64	71
does	DYNAMIC	We fished for the pacu as the native does, kneading a ball of mandioc farina with water and placing it on the hook as bait.	37	41
including	DYNAMIC	More recently, South American rivers including the Amazon have become a popular destination for recreational anglers, who go to fly fish for pacu.	37	45
sponsored	DYNAMIC	The International Game Fishing Organization has sponsored fly-fishing courses for native Brazilian fishermen, typically accustomed to subsistence fishing, so they can work as guides to fishing tourists.	48	56
experiencing	STATIVE	Today, the Amazon river is experiencing a crisis of overfishing.	27	38
shows	STATIVE	"Research shows that the ""flavor of [farmed] pacu is comparable to that of hybrid striped bass, tilapia, and rainbow trout, but superior to catfish."""	9	13

compared	STATIVE	In standard poker, each player bets according to the rank he believes his hand is worth as compared to the other players.	91	98
folded	DYNAMIC	The betting round ends when all players have either matched the last bet or folded.	76	82
placed	DYNAMIC	With the exception of initial forced bets, money is only placed into the pot voluntarily by a player who either believes the bet has positive expected value or who is trying to bluff other players for various strategic reasons.	57	62
chosen	STATIVE	Thus, while the outcome of any particular hand significantly involves chance, the long-run expectations of the players are determined by their actions chosen on the basis of probability, psychology and game theory.	151	156
gone	DYNAMIC	Poker has gained in popularity since the beginning of the twentieth century, and has gone from being primarily a recreational activity confined to small groups of enthusiasts, to a widely popular activity, both for participants and spectators, including online, with many professional players and multi-million dollar tournament prizes.	85	88
depicted	DYNAMIC	By the 1980s, poker was being depicted in popular culture as a commonplace recreational activity.	30	37
featured	DYNAMIC	For example, it was featured in at least 10 episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation as a weekly event of the senior staff of the fictional ship's crew.	20	27

comes	STATIVE	This idea contains the four main doctrines on the Bible: that its teaching is needed for salvation (necessity); that all the doctrine necessary for salvation comes from the Bible alone (sufficiency); that everything taught in the Bible is correct (inerrancy); and that, by the Holy Spirit overcoming sin, believers may read and understand truth from the Bible itself, though understanding is difficult, so the means used to guide individual believers to the true teaching is often mutual discussion within the church (clarity).	158	162
consider	STATIVE	Psychologists of diverse orientations also consider the unconscious mind.	43	50
directed	STATIVE	While psychological knowledge is often applied to the assessment and treatment of mental health problems, it is also directed towards understanding and solving problems in many different spheres of human activity.	117	124

covered	DYNAMIC	Historians note that Greek philosophers, including Thales, Plato, and Aristotle (especially in his De Anima treatise), covered the workings of the mind in their writings.	119	125
credited	STATIVE	German physician Wilhelm Wundt is credited with introducing psychological discovery into a laboratory setting.	34	41
laid	DYNAMIC	In his book, The Principles of Psychology, published in 1890, he laid the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would explore for years to come.	65	68
provided	DYNAMIC	These were largely considered taboo subjects at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society.	68	75
maintained	STATIVE	"Meanwhile, however, researchers in the emerging field of neuro-psychoanalysis defended some of Freud's ideas on scientific grounds, while scholars of the humanities maintained that Freud was not a ""scientist at all, but ... an interpreter."""	165	174
