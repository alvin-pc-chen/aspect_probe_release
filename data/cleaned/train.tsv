going	DYNAMIC	But its not going to happen with the investment of $100 into a single house.	12	16

has	STATIVE	I don't think the audience is laughing at Coons; the laughter has an incredulous, oh-my-god sound to it.	62	64
looks	DYNAMIC	When she hears the reaction, she looks out at the audience with a big, proud grin.	33	37
shows	DYNAMIC	So although this shows what an extremist nut O'Donnell is, it's not really a gaffe; it's standard stuff right out of their playbook.	17	21
looking	DYNAMIC	"Well, if one is looking for the phrase, ""Separation of Church and State,"" yeah, that's not in there, so TADA!"	16	22
wins	DYNAMIC	Looks at me, I wins a big arguments and I poops my pants.	15	18

were	STATIVE	if that were the case.	8	11
have	STATIVE	Yeah, Pea, you have a point there, but still: The laughter doesn't sound incredulous to me, it sounds appreciative and snarky.	15	18
see	DYNAMIC	I don't see a crowd like that laughing out loud at such a pitiful little meme, it's not even worth a laugh-out-loud guffaw.	8	10
had	STATIVE	I know if I had the opportunity to attend a Sarah Palin rally, I'd be overjoyed to hear some incredible stupid falling out of her mouth.	12	14
be	STATIVE	which would be, uh, ANY Sarah Palin rally.	12	14

says	DYNAMIC	"Anyone who says ""Evolution is only a THEORY...it's not a fact"" is so stupid; so utterly fucking brainless, uneducated, ignorant, clueless and unread they should immediately be sterilized on the slim chance that there's a genetic component to their imbecility."	11	14
expected	STATIVE	Anyone who stubbornly knows so little about science cannot possibly be expected to develop the analytical skills necessary to interpret Con Law.	71	78
illustrates	STATIVE	I thinks this illustrates their biblical view of the Constitution, and by that I mean they regard it the same way as they regard the Holy Bible.	14	24
know	DYNAMIC	Oh, and like the Holy Bible, that we mere mortals are not supposed to question or interpret, they'll let us know what it really means and that will often conflict with what it actually says.	108	111
makes	STATIVE	They try to exert some sort of control over it's meaning by elevating it to a level that makes it untouchable.	89	93

was	STATIVE	The debate was at Widener Law School.	11	13

hope	STATIVE	I hope you're well.	2	5
be	STATIVE	While it can be personally satisfying to present all your little ducks in a row, they will never stop erroneously knocking the damn ducks out of line.	13	14
were	STATIVE	Nah, I'm convinced that the audible gasps and stifled chuckles were from her attempt to bluff her way through an exchange regarding the Constitution in a room full of lawyers.	63	66
do	STATIVE	Palin knows her place, as do they all.	26	27
running	DYNAMIC	O'Donnell's running on personality alone, nothing more, nothing less.	12	18
was	STATIVE	However, she clearly thinks she that she has scored a huge win and that the audience was on her side.	85	87
was	STATIVE	"Her question was the equivalent of asking ""Where're the pictures?"""	13	15
staring	DYNAMIC	when staring at the document, especially in that setting.	5	11
did	DYNAMIC	She did it on purpose, not to further the discussion, but to establish that, yes, she is a dependable dumbass.	4	6
have	STATIVE	Lexaburn, I have to disagree with your assessment that this is all a game and that she's not that dumb.	12	15
intend	STATIVE	Being a perpetual campaigner can only get you so far, and if they don't intend to win after getting the nomination, then that con game is limited.	72	77

did	DYNAMIC	Well, Palin did anyway.	12	14

described	STATIVE	O'Donnell is described as a normal conservative Republican woman by my friend.	13	21
leads	DYNAMIC	Some of the innuendo surrounding her leads me to this conclusion, as well.	37	41
being	STATIVE	You know what, I'm being too much of a stuffy doctor.	19	23
making	DYNAMIC	Anyway, that smile she gives after asking about the 1st Amendment may very well be her being in on the joke she's making of herself.	114	119
thinking	STATIVE	Do not try to make sense out of anything of this if you're not thinking like a...celebrity of whatever quality, let's say.	63	70
continues	STATIVE	Next, ask yourself why she continues to be invited to these public forums.	27	35
seen	DYNAMIC	In all my cable news watching, I've seen far more dim characters than O'Donnell with regular gigs, so it's not the fact that she's dumb that gets her on television.	36	39
campaigning	DYNAMIC	She's not campaigning to win anything, I'm telling you, BC.	10	20
was	STATIVE	"I don't believe that was because she beat the ""establishment"" candidate."	21	23
thinking	STATIVE	I'm thinking she's aiming to be on FNC on a regular basis.	4	11
comes	DYNAMIC	This all comes from my observing her debate performances, as well as her more recent TV appearances.	9	13
runs	DYNAMIC	Just look at the clips Bill Maher runs of her blithering, insistent certainty.	34	37
get	STATIVE	She pisses off EVERYONE, all the time, and never once = not a single time ever - stops long enough to even CONSIDER that maybe she's the one who doesn't get it.	153	155
get	STATIVE	It's THEY who don't get it.	20	22
does	STATIVE	She does because she took a week long course at Oxford University!	4	7
lies	DYNAMIC	That she lies about her academic credentials, inflates beyond all reason and truth the actual degree of study she has accomplished, does not in any way diminish her insistence that she IS highly educated - really VERY knowledgeable about all of these things she doesn't know about.	9	12
disagree	DYNAMIC	And if you disagree with her, then you are properly an object of scorn and derision for being so poorly informed about things.	11	18
campaigning	STATIVE	It may not be campaigning to WIN.	14	24
corrupted	DYNAMIC	But in her mind that's because the voters have been brainwashed by the same evil, wrong-headed liberal / progressive indoctrination that has corrupted our schools, our leaders and our society.	141	149
have	STATIVE	Christine O'Donnell doesn't have a hidden agenda.	28	31
sees	STATIVE	She sees herself as morally correct, profoundly right (in both senses of the term), and struggling as only a jebus loving martyr can against the tide of evil sweeping her nation.	4	7
see	STATIVE	She KNOWS things, see?	18	21
going	DYNAMIC	Knowing she's going to lose is not the same thing as running TO lose... in the same way that knowing she really doesn't know much about the constitution will never prevent her from telling you what it must mean.	14	18
deals	DYNAMIC	My wife deals with them all the time at her place of employment.	8	12
forces	STATIVE	"Pushed as an effort to promote ""Sonoma County"" wines and a consumer education effort, the new law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines their own marketing efforts."	106	111

noted	DYNAMIC	"Honore Comfort, Executive Director of the Sonoma County Vintners Association and an outstanding representative for Sonoma County wines noted this: ""."	135	139
marks	DYNAMIC	This moment ...marks the beginning of a stronger Sonoma County brand for generations to come.	12	19
has	STATIVE	"Why is it important for someone making ""Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir"" or ""Sonoma Valley Zinfandel"" to help promote ""Sonoma County"", a designation that has no ability to define the quality or character of the wines in my Sonoma Coast Pinot Noir or my Sonoma Valley Zinfandel?"	146	148

estimate	DYNAMIC	I could estimate, no doubt.	8	16
have	STATIVE	What I expected it to be was a simple way to at least know what the total carbon footprint from your flights for some period was (after all, they have all the data), and ideally, a simple way to buy offsets.	146	149

worked	DYNAMIC	A cap & trade system worked very well at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution in the US, finance types and all.	21	26
wants	STATIVE	You're right that a carbon tax is definitely simpler, but there are upsides to cap & trade as well (such as the fact that the market will drive the price up, whereas a tax won't increase unless Congress wants it to).	203	207

argued	DYNAMIC	"Carbon offsetting was ""an unbelievably inefficient way of reducing emissions,"" she argued, and its effects were impossible to verify."	83	89

being	STATIVE	The cost for large companies to make any updates to their e-commerce sites is significant, another factor in keeping the type of program you'd like from being available.	153	157

dealt	DYNAMIC	When asked how he dealt with the nay Sayers and the analysts who wrote Fannie Mae off, Maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company.	18	22
going	DYNAMIC	"We were going to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake Fannie Maw into a great company."""	8	12

discussed	DYNAMIC	We also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals.	8	16

attached	DYNAMIC	I have attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose d amendments to AB1X.	7	14
designed	STATIVE	Our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near- and long-term electricity crisis in California.	42	49
took	DYNAMIC	Solution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took a step in the right direction.	71	74
designed	DYNAMIC	Utility stand-by charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract monopoly prices from customers, or both.	42	49
takes	STATIVE	These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for California to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer.	58	62
designed	STATIVE	We would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation.	75	82
requires	STATIVE	Solution: The Governor,s executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right direction*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within 7 days.	110	117
face	DYNAMIC	In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations.	51	54
continues	DYNAMIC	In addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to face local opposition.	61	69
ensure	DYNAMIC	The State should ensure that local, parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects .	17	22
issued	STATIVE	Enron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with suppliers.	27	32
appears	STATIVE	From our analysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the California PUC,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.	52	58
Regarding	STATIVE	"Ambiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract ""Prudence"" The language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public Utilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are ""imprudent."""	31	39
associated	STATIVE	On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref use to allow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases.	110	119
have	STATIVE	Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that DWR has entered into with suppliers.	24	27
identified	DYNAMIC	We have identified three options:	8	17
working	DYNAMIC	Clarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and through Contract Language This is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to implement.	139	145

attached	DYNAMIC	We have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC would need to issue under this option.	8	15
indicated	DYNAMIC	DWR officials have indicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options.	19	27
made	DYNAMIC	They diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.	69	72
found	DYNAMIC	Al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are likely.	119	123
recommended	STATIVE	California's supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West.	101	111
makes	STATIVE	California's very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement.	37	41
curtailed	DYNAMIC	Other reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early draw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California's seve re supply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities.	260	268
added	DYNAMIC	Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.	141	145

takes	DYNAMIC	Increase supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher) To site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years.	96	100
takes	DYNAMIC	In California, it takes about six years, or longer.	18	22
seeks	STATIVE	Enron's proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2) transfering credits between air districts.	17	21
offers	DYNAMIC	Decrease demand*Legislative Vehicle: AB31X (Wright) Because of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing the supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.	192	197
run	DYNAMIC	DWR could easily run an on-line auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.	17	19
developed	DYNAMIC	"Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, ""D eal Bench,"" that it would be willing to contribute to the effort."	10	18
allowing	DYNAMIC	fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding.	161	168
estimate	DYNAMIC	We estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in excess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for summer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.	3	10
protected	STATIVE	The only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we re customers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers.	28	36
takes	DYNAMIC	Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from customers and businesses.	17	21
removed	DYNAMIC	In addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function.	90	96
begin	DYNAMIC	California should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a non-utility provider within 36 months.	28	32
hold	DYNAMIC	To execute the transition, California should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load.	45	48
does	DYNAMIC	In short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California's supply-demand imbalance.	21	24
bear	DYNAMIC	"In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having California State government assume the role of ""electricity buyer"" for an extended period of time."	84	87

owe	STATIVE	Kim: I have completed the invoices for April, May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $3,615,910.62.	66	68
owe	DYNAMIC	If I go by what is currently in the system as a guide, Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $1 mil.	70	72
need	DYNAMIC	I need to forecast the money today, so please let me know what you would like to do.	2	5
owe	STATIVE	Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.	42	44
flows	DYNAMIC	I have no idea what flows.	20	25
take	DYNAMIC	It doesn't take long to create the calc sheets.	11	14
provide	DYNAMIC	I understand from Janine that you or Patti can provide me with the detail that I need.	47	53
come	DYNAMIC	If necessary, I can come pick it up.	20	23
have	DYNAMIC	For payment, we have to forecast the money two days out.	16	19
pay	STATIVE	thats fine - we can't pay them anyway	22	24
shoot	DYNAMIC	Any user of Pine 3.05 (and as far as I can tell 3.07 or 2.x) can shoot themself in the foot (head if you prefer) by setting character-set = Zeldas_private_codepage.	65	69
do	DYNAMIC	This is almost certainly a bad idea, especially if (as Rick implied in another part of the referenced message) the user can do so by setting a default charset value in a user configuration file somewhere.	124	125
lets	STATIVE	I'm not sure what the feature in question is, but if it's something which lets users specify the value to be sent out as the MIME Content-Type: charset, I think it's a bad idea, and should be removed or significantly altered.	74	77
find	STATIVE	I find that the best way to think about charset is that it is *neither*.	2	5
selected	DYNAMIC	It should be more likely that the charset value be selected by an automaton, not by a human.	51	58
finds	STATIVE	(If anyone finds the above paragraph startling, you're welcome to write to me for clarification.	11	15
going	DYNAMIC	I'm not going to prolong this message with additional explanations right now.)	8	12
suggested	DYNAMIC	I've suggested that as a first pass the charset should only be settable in the system config file, and that the charset always be coerced to US-ASCII unless the text contains 8-bit characters and/or has ``funny'' control characters such as ESC or SI/SO.	5	13
needed	STATIVE	More work would definitely be needed in this area, but you'll appreciate that there are other, higher priorities just now...	30	35
needed	STATIVE	More work would definitely be needed in thi s area, but you'll appreciate that there are other, higher priorities just now...	30	35

map	STATIVE	"The long term solution is, of course, to map between ""character sets"" (which the use should have control over) and ""charsets"" (which the user should leave alone)."	41	43
maintain	STATIVE	I maintain that CHARSET specification should be omitted when feasible.	2	9
needed	STATIVE	For the former, use Base64 encoding when needed.	41	47
defined	STATIVE	Plain text is defined differently from system to system.	14	20
called	DYNAMIC	"99 times out of 100 you don't care, but there's that 1% of the time when you've called it US-ASCII and it's NOT anymore, although it *is* still legitimate ""plain text""."	80	85
helps	DYNAMIC	That helps.	5	10
NOT	DYNAMIC	That's why I ask that (today, 1993) we NOT LABEL true plain text as US-ASCII/ISO-8859-1.	39	41
missed	DYNAMIC	And let me reiterate that I'm not mad at the Pine developers (nor the MIME developers; not mad at anyone, just trying to push a point that I think is important and has been missed).	173	180
set	STATIVE	A message that contains characters with the high bit set CANNOT BE US-ASCII, and therefore, a text/plain message without a charset= label in it that has such characters IS NOT LEGAL MIME.	53	55
designed	STATIVE	This was deliberate design, designed to promote interoperability.	28	35
read	STATIVE	End of flame..............if you want a couple of tons more, read the archives of the SMTP and RFC-822 groups.	61	64
pretend	STATIVE	And if it violates the RFC it isn't MIME and shouldn't pretend to be.	55	61
registered	STATIVE	All of the RFC 1345 character sets are registered for MIME use.	39	48
enclosing	DYNAMIC	I am enclosing the approved version of the charter.	5	13
defines	STATIVE	I believe that the revised charter defines most of the issues and defines them well.	35	41
needed	STATIVE	However, our criteria for this BOF should be that it helps illuminate and define the problem and advances the understanding needed to define WGs, and I think it is more likely to do that than anything else we are likely to come up with.	124	129
see	DYNAMIC	"And it is ""only"" a BOF and does not commit us to long-term action until we see the outcome and Borka's minutes."	75	77
found	STATIVE	This means that the Directory must be able to handle national characters not found in the US-ASCII repetoire.	77	81
provided	DYNAMIC	This is especially a problem as information services are provided for clients on various difference hardware architectures.	57	64
make	DYNAMIC	"(3) Is there a solution that will make character set convertors for diffrent codes ""plug-and-play"" (i.e."	34	37
make	DYNAMIC	(5) If we need to solve these problems and UCS (ISO 10 646) is the only available general option today which is maybe close to be sufficient, can we start with UCS and make minimal changes or specifications which will be sufficient for our needs.	168	171
left	STATIVE	(5.1) The order of octets in the interchange of data is left to be specified by the sender and the recipient in UCS.	56	59
assigned	DYNAMIC	Who knows if ISO 10646 has been assigned numbers and escape sequences?	32	39
assigned	DYNAMIC	Escape sequences are assigned by the Registration Authority, and the Registration Authority is now with ECMA.	21	28
felt	STATIVE	I have not much time to spend on this subject, but I would have felt bad not to express these opinions once.	64	67
work	STATIVE	I participated to the design of Kermit multinational 8-bit characters support and the TCP/IP network I work for is well on the way towards the the same theory that every character on the communication line is ISO 8859-1.	103	106
considered	STATIVE	Any exception to this, like translating EBCDIC directly to PC code on one machine, is considered harmful to our internetworking, even if convenient.	86	95
start	DYNAMIC	Every piece working towards a common well defined goal finally pays more when all parts start to clutch than wandering for immediate interest.	88	92
adopted	DYNAMIC	To solve this problem, rules like XDR (external data representation) have been devised, and, because it was so important, the rules have been adopted.	142	149
becomes	DYNAMIC	Now that networking reaches its real dimension of an international mesh, the problem of national languages usage becomes very real, at least locally, but more and more internationally.	113	119
has	DYNAMIC	Any computer has to exchange more than ASCII.	13	15
modified	DYNAMIC	It is best for a computer to use the code of interchange internally, but all computers in the world cannot be modified overnight.	110	117
amplified	STATIVE	The impact of today's decisions is amplified by time.	35	43
refer	DYNAMIC	What seems clear in my mind is that the translation is not in several final protocols, but a protocol by itself -- like XDR -- that other protocols refer to.	148	152
extends	STATIVE	"Note that the ""level 6 or so"" concept applied to text extends slightly beyond the representation of characters (and binary data) towards file structure."	54	60
take	DYNAMIC	Clearly, it will take much time to stand in ASCII's shoes.	17	20
take	DYNAMIC	But doing otherwise would take even longer to erase and redo.	26	29
write	DYNAMIC	If you write anything you want me to read, please make a personal reply and allow for two weeks before I can read it.	7	11
asked	STATIVE	What is an FAQ is a frequently asked question.	31	35
made	DYNAMIC	David made some excellent points regarding STLP.	6	9
working	STATIVE	Microsoft and Netscape are working with the IETF to create one IETF standard which both companies can support.	27	33
been	DYNAMIC	As you pointed out, there has been some confusion over this issue.	30	33
labeled	DYNAMIC	It was unfortunate that the strawman document was labeled as a draft in the press and by others.	50	56
is	DYNAMIC	"I believe that what you are saying is that no draft was ""submitted,"" but rather ""made available for review,"" albeit with rather late instructions as to location and ownership."	35	36
raised	DYNAMIC	"All the above reflects my personal belief that this particular BOF-cum-WG should stretch to maintain the status of ""Caesar's wife;"" and also reflects my concern at the questions being raised by others last week."	184	189
expected	STATIVE	"Rendering into other media (such as speech) is expected to communicate, essentially, a ""mental picture"" of the 2-dimensional form of an expression."	47	54
have	DYNAMIC	(Rationale: since almost all mathematics is conventionally expressed in 2-dimensional graphical form, most notations in that medium have no standard version in other media.)	132	135
make	DYNAMIC	Check out (listen to ) some of the demos on my AsTeR WWW site-- they make the point about spoken renderings being *independent* of the visual 2D layout far better than I am capable of in a plain-text email message.	69	72
make	DYNAMIC	Dave has been unable to find any time that all of us can make.	57	61
accepted	DYNAMIC	Ralph Youngen, Associate Director, Electronic Product Development for AMS has accepted the invitation to join the group, along with a couple of his colleagues.	78	85
is	DYNAMIC	When using operator precedence, there is a need to constrain the context in which given operators can be used.	38	39
appear	STATIVE	Niel said this wasn't as simple as at first it might appear.	53	59
work	DYNAMIC	Dave will work on a formal mechanism for this.	10	13
agreed	DYNAMIC	"We agreed however, that a fixed set of ""layout"" idioms are sufficient for HTML-math."	3	8
gone	DYNAMIC	Critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award.	17	20
going	DYNAMIC	It is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of Michael Moore that has been going on in the United States since the release of his last documentary.	96	100
perceived	STATIVE	"In a time of simple-minded patriotism, loud, clear and dissenting voices like Mr. Moore's are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced, partially through well funded public relations campaigns, partially through conservative ""grass-roots"" propaganda."	94	102
cause	DYNAMIC	After all, early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence -- because Canadians like, and Japanese positively love, those.	123	127
killed	DYNAMIC	The latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in Rwanda in 1994, which killed 800,000 people.	104	109
had	STATIVE	Similarly, the main motivation for the crusades (beyond the promise of wealth) was that Christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved.	137	139
presents	DYNAMIC	Interactive fiction like video games, on the other hand, presents violence in a narrative context, which may very well desensitize participants to said violence, but no causative link has ever been proven.	57	64
described	DYNAMIC	This is consistent with the kind of media-incited violence described above, and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence.	59	67
shared	STATIVE	Moore's second hypothesis is that America's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts, a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists.	168	173
known	STATIVE	Children who grow up in war-torn regions are known for having similar views -- war is perceived as a normal part of existence, violence as a natural way to solve disputes.	45	49
projected	DYNAMIC	"In a weaker sense, the same message is projected to American children, who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another, but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how ""the enemies of freedom"" are punished."	39	47
made	DYNAMIC	Moore's film was made before the dead bodies of Qusay and Uday Hussein were paraded on national TV.	17	20
goes	STATIVE	That goes for your grandson Mustafa too, by the way.	5	8
killed	DYNAMIC	Mustafa was 14 years when he was killed.	33	39
wonder	STATIVE	Americans cheer the killing of children, yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations.	45	50
seeks	DYNAMIC	It is paradoxical notions like this one which Moore's film seeks to address.	59	63
listed	STATIVE	1) The bank scene, listed on your website on a separate page.	19	24
stated	DYNAMIC	"Critics have stated that this scene was ""staged"", but in the bank interview, the official tells Moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time."	13	18
explained	STATIVE	"It is not explained what ""normally"" is supposed to mean, but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film."	10	18
claims	DYNAMIC	This sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes, but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against Moore.	112	117
makes	STATIVE	This is plausible -- but entirely irrelevant for the movie, which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed.	74	78
does	DYNAMIC	The bank does exactly what it advertises: It hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account.	9	12
repeated	DYNAMIC	This is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often, and it also the most inaccurate.	30	37
are	DYNAMIC	First, the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly.	39	41
goes	STATIVE	The dialogue goes as follows:	13	16
builds	DYNAMIC	"Moore: ""So you don't think our kids say to themselves, gee, dad goes off to the factory every day - he builds missiles."	103	108
being	DYNAMIC	McCollum understands it this way -- otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized.	81	85
presented	DYNAMIC	However, critics of Moore have cleverly ignored McCollum's response and presented Moore as spreading lies about the Lockheed plant.	72	80
make	DYNAMIC	"In response to one Moore detractor, McCollum wrote: ""Although other units of Lockheed Martin Corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the U.S., we make no weapons at the Littleton-area facility Moore visited."""	185	188
points	DYNAMIC	As Moore correctly points out, it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons, but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence -- children learn by imitating adults.	19	24
have	DYNAMIC	It is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication, but in doing so, they themselves have, unlike Moore, made many incorrect claims.	125	129
claim	STATIVE	"This is a common technique, but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking, they believe critics who claim that he is ""distorting"" the interview."	134	138
have	DYNAMIC	"Moore's critics would expect us to have him quote Heston in his entirety, have him present fully the PR that the NRA has used to justify its rally in Denver for reasons of ""balance""."	35	38
claim	STATIVE	"You claim that there was ""no way to change location, since you have to give advance notice of that to the members, and there were upwards of 4,000,000 members."""	4	8
had	STATIVE	10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date, had the NRA really wanted to.	86	88
did	DYNAMIC	That does not change the fact that they did just that.	40	42
shows	STATIVE	"This booing by the crowd, not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article, shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to Littleton after children were being killed there -- and they effectively said ""Fuck you""."	95	99
works	DYNAMIC	"Again, standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion: ""Moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum -- with completely false ideas."	83	87
kept	DYNAMIC	This is naive to the extreme -- Heston would not be president of the NRA if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence.	87	90
respond	DYNAMIC	Even if he did not respond to that part of the interview, he certainly knew about the case at that point.	19	25
got	DYNAMIC	Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression.	135	137
see	DYNAMIC	In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March.	43	45
happened	DYNAMIC	"c) Both the ""soccer mom"" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact."	126	133
makes	STATIVE	This makes no sense.	5	9
led	DYNAMIC	The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly.	56	58
does	DYNAMIC	"In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is ""full of lies""."	25	28
wanted	DYNAMIC	"These people do not feel the need to express sympathy, or to think about ways to avoid such incidents, but they feel the need to assert their ""rights"" and to look for quick, simple answers -- as Busch states, gun owners wanted to ""hang [the child] from the highest tree""."	220	225
have	DYNAMIC	"From this, you construct an obscure conspiracy of ""re-enactment"": ""For all we can tell, Moore could have shouted 'Hey!'"	100	103
left	DYNAMIC	"to make Heston turn around and then remained silent as Heston left."""	62	67
see	STATIVE	"Even if your ""re-enactment"" theory is true (and I see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion), this itself is not unethical, and you have no evidence whatsoever that Moore has done anything unethical here, just like you have no evidence that Moore has unethically removed parts of the interview."	50	52
consider	STATIVE	Of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified, and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film.	65	72
looks	DYNAMIC	It is the typical right-wing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the Republican mindset.	44	48
made	DYNAMIC	"It is equally well known that the so-called ""war on drugs"" begun under the Nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made America the world leader in prison population (both in relative and absolute numbers)."	149	152
seen	STATIVE	In poor areas, the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort.	70	73
had	STATIVE	"Had the boy's mother not been shipped to a ""welfare to work"" program, she might at least have had some time to spend with her son."	94	96
seen	DYNAMIC	In reality, what Moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery I have ever seen, to the detriment of families.	116	120
called	DYNAMIC	"It is notable that the Wall Street Journal's reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours: It called Moore's claim ""preposterous""."	122	127
warned	DYNAMIC	Never mind the fact that authors such as Robert Scheer warned of aiding the Taliban as early as in May 2001.	55	60
did	DYNAMIC	Never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation, but because of the Taliban's violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies.	21	23
dwell	DYNAMIC	Statistics are Moore's weakest point, and it is surprising that his critics don't dwell on them longer.	82	86
found	DYNAMIC	A good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncite.com website.	57	61
compares	DYNAMIC	Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology.	32	39
mentioned	DYNAMIC	The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are:	47	56
cited	DYNAMIC	In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited.	95	100
seek	DYNAMIC	"It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John ""Mary"" Lott."	64	67
shows	DYNAMIC	Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart.	8	12
fail	STATIVE	"Once again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and ""faking"" (a word which ""Canadian officials"" have never used; for such a distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics)."	16	19
made	DYNAMIC	He made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification.	3	6
portrayed	DYNAMIC	You conclude from Heston's own words that Heston was somehow portrayed as racist.	61	69
comes	DYNAMIC	Other than towards the NRA, the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions, and comes up with some thoughtful answers.	86	90
look	DYNAMIC	Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others.	47	50
noted	STATIVE	One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language.	36	40
speaks	DYNAMIC	The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry.	88	93
formed	DYNAMIC	In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers.	33	38
plays	STATIVE	Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has.	9	13
tied	STATIVE	Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their “indigenous identity”, and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.	102	105
maintained	DYNAMIC	Initially the Spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system, in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land.	101	110
resulting	DYNAMIC	In reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the Spanish, resulting in modern-day malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the Spanish colonialists (Warren 1978, 7-8).	74	82
recognized	DYNAMIC	The impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the Marxist movements of the early 20th century.	60	69
maintained	STATIVE	Those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations; previously, both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant Spanish culture.	154	163
possessed	STATIVE	The Marxists, on the contrary, argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity.	66	74
claimed	DYNAMIC	However, they also claimed that they were part of a larger group, the working class, whose poverty was a direct result of American imperialism; therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a worker-friendly one (Jackson 1995: 6-7).	19	25
maintain	STATIVE	Guerrilla warfare has since become a part of Colombian life; multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence, often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples.	77	84
make	STATIVE	This resulted in persecution against the Mayans, who make up about 60% of the overall population.	53	56
seen	STATIVE	By the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen, and indigenous rights movements formed (Warren 2003: 174, Jackson 2002: 82).	75	79
speak	DYNAMIC	Most still speak it in various forms, and efforts by Mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent, modern version of Maya (England 2003: 733, 739).	11	15
continues	STATIVE	The popular left, however, continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool.	27	35
benefits	STATIVE	The Pan-Mayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on Guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the (often negative) attention of the government (England 2003: 735, Warren 2003: 181).	28	35
seek	STATIVE	Pan-Mayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to Maya as it was in its classical renaissance, a language of power and prestige (England 2003: 736).	28	31
divided	STATIVE	"Colombia, in contrast, has no unified ""pan-Indian"" sentiments; the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population, a fractured entity divided by region and language."	155	161
poses	STATIVE	Several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed: the ONIC poses itself as the sole pan-Indian group, yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 83, 85).	104	108
stands	STATIVE	It often stands in conflict with the AICO, its Guambiano counterpart (Jackson 2003: 83-84).	9	14
stood	STATIVE	The Nasa and Guambiano have stood in opposition since pre-colonial times; therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best (Rappaport 2005: 2).	28	32
forced	STATIVE	The return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity: no longer ruled by Western laws and discourse, communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era.	144	149
stands	STATIVE	The Colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the Guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999.	27	32
codified	STATIVE	Mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord; by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the Colombian constitution (Warren 2002: 157-158).	201	208
covered	STATIVE	However, it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many Mayans to assimilate, as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility, and a belief among the general population that Mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution (Warren 2002: 159, 172).	251	257
encourages	DYNAMIC	Nonetheless, in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages, which while reaffirming Spanish as the official language, recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion.	216	225
seen	STATIVE	While largely symbolic, it is still significant in that Guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than Spanish.	79	82
manifests	STATIVE	This question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in Guatemala and Colombia.	49	57
considered	STATIVE	An example is the Tukanoans: while considered a single “ethnic group”, they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy, in which members of one language group must marry into another (Jackson 1995: 4).	35	44
aided	STATIVE	Conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed, often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and non-governmental organizations.	136	140
lead	DYNAMIC	The differences between Western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves: the question of embracing Western law and discourse is continually grappled with.	60	63
proved	DYNAMIC	Translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task, as Western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision.	45	50
employed	DYNAMIC	Translation fulfills another vital role, as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself.	50	57
work	DYNAMIC	Workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge, distancing them from the Western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries.	40	43
raising	STATIVE	Many native peoples in Colombia are monolingual Spanish speakers, raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use.	66	72
governing	DYNAMIC	The differences between cosmovision in Spanish and indigenous languages are great, leading to the difficulty of governing in Spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought.	112	120
divide	STATIVE	In addition, there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity; the Nasa, for example, divide themselves into the traditional, modern, and new.	143	148
established	DYNAMIC	In Guatemala the fact remains that Spanish is the gateway to social mobility; years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one, and those literate in Spanish have the tools to do so.	120	130
perceived	STATIVE	The ONIC of Colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not “Indian enough”; it embraces the use of Spanish and Western discourse, leading to distrust among indigenous peoples (Jackson 2002: 85).	62	70
appears	STATIVE	Politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly, even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking Spanish; indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself.	259	265
provides	STATIVE	The Colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group; the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing self-determination in the eyes of the Colombian government requires emphasizing differences.	53	60
endanger	STATIVE	Efforts towards development, then, cannot endanger traditional culture and values, for fear of losing cultural legitimacy (Jackson 1995: 5).	42	49
develops	STATIVE	There develops a duality in native culture; for example, many Nasa children receive instruction in Nasa Yuwe yet converse in Spanish outside the classroom.	6	13
poses	DYNAMIC	This intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed.	54	58
view	STATIVE	In Colombia, legal successes have often come about due to the Colombian government's recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights; by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife, and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not (Jackson 1995: 8).	257	260
focusing	DYNAMIC	The discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the Concerto, focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement.	73	80
describes	DYNAMIC	Harmonic Structure and Form Bartók describes the form of the first movement as “more or less regular sonata form.” Bartók, 431.	35	43
presents	DYNAMIC	While that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion, it is perfectly accurate: the movement is in sonata form, but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement (not unheard of in Mozart sonatas), and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order.	270	277
employs	DYNAMIC	The “backwards” recapitulation is a technique that Bartók employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates.	58	64
shows	DYNAMIC	Example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement; the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction.	10	14
makes	DYNAMIC	Hence, on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation FTG-STG-FTG which makes the overall form, with the exception of the Introduction, symmetric.	105	109
discusses	DYNAMIC	Paul Wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement, although his interpretation is somewhat different.	17	25
stand	STATIVE	|| Intro | FTG | STG | Dev I (FTG) | Dev II (new) | Dev III (FTG) | STG | FTG || The abbreviations FTG and STG stand for First Theme Group and Second Theme Group, respectively.	111	115
find	STATIVE	While “tonality” in this piece (and in Bartók’s music in general) is quite different from its classical interpretation, we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonata-form structure.	123	126
represented	STATIVE	Beginning with the exposition, the large-scale progression of tonal centers is a whole-tone descent from F to F, represented by the stemmed notes in Example 2, while the Introduction ascends from C♯ to F through D♯ (shown as D♭ and E♭ in the graph) in a quasi-bass Anstieg.	113	123
seek	STATIVE	Paul Wilson gives a detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis; we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his findings.	116	119
focus	DYNAMIC	Our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure.	18	22
draws	DYNAMIC	The Introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movement—in fact, it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this section—but the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece.	129	133
presents	DYNAMIC	To begin with, the opening motive in the celli and basses, shown in Example 3, outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents C♯ as the tonal center.	118	125
seen	STATIVE	Indeed, this set can be seen more as a by-product of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself.	24	27
adds	DYNAMIC	example 3: measures 1-6 (celli and basses) example 4: measures 12-16 (celli and basses) example 5: measures 22-29 (celli, basses and violas) Example 4 transitions from C♯ to F♯, and adds pitch-class E to the pentatonic set of Example 3, creating a six-note set of stacked fourths.	182	185
represented	STATIVE	The overall motion in the first 29 measures is C♯ to D♯, through F♯; these are represented enharmonically in Example 2 as D♭, E♭ and G♭.	79	89
see	DYNAMIC	155-233), and as we will see, it occurs in other places, though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in Example 2.	25	28
see	DYNAMIC	The section from measures 35-50 is centered on E; upon the return of D♯, enharmonically respelled as E♭, in measure 58, we see that E acts as its upper-neighbor.	123	125
describes	DYNAMIC	Paul Wilson describes the transition from the Introduction to the Exposition as “quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated,” Wilson, 173. but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition.	12	20
employ	STATIVE	While the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the Introduction is clear in the latter, the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation.	128	133
follows	DYNAMIC	example 8: measures 76-80 (violins) Rhythmically, we have a dissonance between the melody, which follows the written meter, and the accompanying chords in the bassoons, horns and lower strings.	97	103
illustrates	DYNAMIC	Example 11 illustrates this structure.	11	21
following	DYNAMIC	Immediately following the arrival of E♭ in the bass, C♯ (D♭) is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme.	12	20
claims	DYNAMIC	example 11: bass structure of the first theme group, measures 76-155 example 12: measures 134-141 (trombone) Wilson claims that C and E♭ are “local dominants” to F in this first section of the exposition.	116	121
imply	DYNAMIC	While the strong V-I motion from measures 90-91 does carry a tonal implication of dominant-tonic, such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context.	134	138
established	DYNAMIC	E♭, furthermore, is not convincingly established as a dominant-functioning tone at all.	37	47
consider	STATIVE	Rather, we can consider this occurrence of E♭ as a middleground-level whole-tone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to E♭ at measure 131 that is represented in Example 2.	15	22
beginning	STATIVE	This creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning, a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge.	99	108
dominates	DYNAMIC	B dominates as tonal center from measures 155-191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it.	2	10
filled	DYNAMIC	A♭ intervenes between E♭ and D♭ in measure 195—another instance of the whole-tone being “filled in” by a fourth.	88	94
is	DYNAMIC	The return to B in measure 210 is also filled-in in this way by F♯ in measures 208-209.	31	32
being	DYNAMIC	Hence, measures 155-210 constitute the bass progression B-E♭-D♭-B; the same stepwise descent (E♭-D♭) occurred in the first theme group while F rather than B was being prolonged.	161	165
established	DYNAMIC	In our terminology, this is the point at which B is unequivocally established as the structural dominant.	66	76
divided	STATIVE	The Development As mentioned, the development is divided into three subsections.	49	55
claims	DYNAMIC	Although Wilson claims that this theme is based on “a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second head-motive of [the first-theme],” Wilson, 182. there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives, and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm, contour and interval content are changed.	16	21
spelled	DYNAMIC	example 13: measures 248-264 (violins) The second section of the development is in C♯ (which is sometimes spelled D♭).	106	112
is	DYNAMIC	This section is reproduced as Example 14.	13	14
established	STATIVE	Although the C♯ major chord in measure 293, preceded by A♭ major (V) in measure 285, suggests C♯ as tonal center, the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303.	143	153
found	STATIVE	As previously mentioned, the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the Introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme.	86	90
allows	STATIVE	The second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth, but the first note is B♭ rather than C, which allows Bartók to remain in this pentatonic set (and also to reinforce B♭ as tonal center).	135	140
reproduced	STATIVE	example 16: measures 316-318: establishment of b♭ The second instance of the fugato section, not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in Example 18, is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on C. The inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363.	97	106
presented	DYNAMIC	The second theme is initially presented in A, as part of the whole-tone descent, and proceeds directly to G, where it is restated slightly modified.	30	38
led	DYNAMIC	It is worth pointing out that the arrival on G at measure 425 is led into by D, which constitutes another “filling in” of the whole-step by the intervening fourth.	65	67
leads	DYNAMIC	The A♯ in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area, but it leads to D in measure 444, which constitutes a V chord still applied to G. Rather than resolve this D back to G, however, Bartók shifts briefly to F♯ in measure 456 and leads to E in measure 467.	74	78
recognized	DYNAMIC	The return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such; however, there are some important differences.	55	64
had	STATIVE	Firstly, its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it; the first chord in Example 9 is an F-minor triad, and the first four notes of Example 8 ascend the F-minor scale.	50	52
thought	STATIVE	In fact, the chord progression of the first four measures of Example 19 can be thought of tonally as I-vi-V in F major—while we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major (the conspicuous A♭ in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation), we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation.	79	85
appears	DYNAMIC	In addition to the “mode”-shift, we notice that the metric dissonance shown in Examples 9 and 10 no longer appears (notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in Example 19) and also that the written meter no longer changes.	107	113
drives	DYNAMIC	There are also no phrase divisions—the music simply drives forward with no pause until measure 514, where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious V-I cadence, signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes.	52	57
falls	STATIVE	Thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as Heinrich Schenker and others, we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal music—their system, however, is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum.	204	208
apply	DYNAMIC	But if we apply it to music such as Bartók’s that is in the middle area, we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results.	10	14
find	DYNAMIC	By applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm, we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain, but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions.	89	92
understand	DYNAMIC	It is not disputed that Bartók’s music has great expressive power—perhaps now we can understand why.	85	94
made	STATIVE	The world is made up of a myriad of colors.	13	16
seen	STATIVE	At the same time in our modern society, color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space.	55	58
seen	STATIVE	color is seen as corrupting, intoxicating, disorienting and in art, has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch.	9	12
placed	DYNAMIC	We went from times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence.	103	108
becomes	DYNAMIC	It is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or emerald… color, then, is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature, while drawing becomes the medium of expression, more and more dominant, the higher we rise in the scale of being”(Blanc, Chromophobia, p.25).	168	174
demanded	STATIVE	For them, reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form.	55	62
proved	DYNAMIC	This reduction of color and expression proved the purity the artist had reached within himself, it was a means of reducing down to the essence of a thing.	39	44
explains	DYNAMIC	In the Elimination of color in the Far East, Izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color.	52	59
manifests	DYNAMIC	“This artistic acestism, i.e., the suppression of externals and the reduction of all colors to black and white, manifests its real aesthetic function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and their subtle hues.	112	120
disclosed	DYNAMIC	In other words, the true profundity of the beauty of black and white is disclosed only to those eyes that are able to appreciate the splendors of sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate shades and tints”(Izutsu, p. 169).	72	80
seen	STATIVE	For black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as non-colors.	32	35
finds	DYNAMIC	It is through these means that one finds the essence in a thing.	35	39
seen	STATIVE	color became a moral issue, seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to the essence of life and form.	28	31
speaks	DYNAMIC	It is something which speaks to the senses, not the mind, it is external and therefore secondary to life.	22	27
deals	DYNAMIC	It deals with the body, emotions, not the intellect.	3	7
makes	DYNAMIC	It is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire, and to desire is to lose control over oneself.	30	34
seen	STATIVE	White is seen as representing spirituality, the heavens, and light, it is all which is modern, it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color.	9	12
directs	DYNAMIC	“WHITE is the spiritual color of our times, the clearness which directs all out actions.	64	70
placed	DYNAMIC	For these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of colors.	44	49
exposes	STATIVE	“The white surface exposes color, presents it for disciplining.	19	25
keeps	DYNAMIC	It keeps an eye on all the objects it frames.	3	7
makes	DYNAMIC	Just as those from the Far East, the purity of white implies what has been washed away and thus makes the white glitter even more.	96	100
stand	STATIVE	White and black stand out because of color, and color stand out because of white and black.	16	20
assisted	STATIVE	In a mosque for example, the architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by a strategic use of color: “All these things are clothed in a majestic coat of whitewash.	74	81
stand	STATIVE	The forms stand out clearly; the impeccable construction displays all its boldness.	10	14
helps	DYNAMIC	White helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash, it brings together and unites.	6	10
expresses	DYNAMIC	“White expresses a certain incorporeality.	7	15
seen	STATIVE	“In the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing, all the details of the form and color of the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this background…In this a form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in “closed” spaces”(Wigley, p. 313).	323	326
dressed	DYNAMIC	In the 19th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white, while men dressed in black (Wigley).	91	97
expresses	DYNAMIC	Crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury, and leisure.	34	42
live	DYNAMIC	The same goes with white walls, in their impeccability it proved to whoever, that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space, or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint.	112	115
distinguishing	DYNAMIC	The use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of distinguishing oneself from the vulgar, normal, lower classes.	74	87
are	DYNAMIC	“..it is also worthy of remark, that savage nations, uneducated people, and children have a great predilection for vivid colors; that animals are excited to rage by certain colors; that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are about them, and seem inclined to banish them altogether from their presence”(Chromophobia, p. 112).	142	144
survived	STATIVE	“In the prevailing styles of the European bourgeoisie, there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color, with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors, such as white, black and gray”(The Style Engine, p. 40).	66	73
marked	DYNAMIC	Wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society, the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so.	29	34
seen	STATIVE	This simplicity of dress was seen as a mark of the modern man.	29	32
had	STATIVE	Other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white.	66	68
had	STATIVE	Above all, it is believed that the expanse of literacy and the printed word, mainly the newspaper, had a profound effect in influencing the choice of black and white.	99	101
viewed	STATIVE	“This world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform, a world in “black and white”.	16	21
seen	STATIVE	The world of print was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man.	33	36
seen	DYNAMIC	This then translated down into the world of fashion, as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing, as well as art, namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space.	56	59
called	STATIVE	“Kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of Western Europe and America and established what is called universal literacy”(Greenberg).	131	136
made	DYNAMIC	In order to meet the demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the attention of consumers.	87	90
continues	DYNAMIC	Greenberg continues by saying, “Kitsch, using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture, welcomes and cultivates this insensibility.	10	18
operates	DYNAMIC	Kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas.	25	32
according	DYNAMIC	Kitsch changes according to style, but remains always the same.	15	23
considered	STATIVE	Avant guard at the time was considered to be true art, while this kitsch was simply pure imitation.	28	37
deemed	STATIVE	Thus said, this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious, high art, while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes.	138	143
allowed	DYNAMIC	Of course during the early stages of color film and photography, the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look, whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images.	152	158
was	DYNAMIC	That was what made up the essence of an image, not the artificial, or superficial filling in of form with color.	5	7
thought	STATIVE	Color was thought to distract the viewer from the soul of the image.	10	16
being	DYNAMIC	These beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality.	77	81
seen	STATIVE	Still though black and white is seen as something of a more sober tradition.	32	35
allow	STATIVE	These non colors allow for the appreciation of color.	17	21
seen	STATIVE	It is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process.	68	71
seeing	DYNAMIC	Now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color, but perhaps it is human instinct, to want to surpass and rebel against generations before, so possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration.	40	45
claim	DYNAMIC	Still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be cured.	17	21
stop	STATIVE	No one knows for sure, and it is possible no one ever will, but that surely does not stop everyone from coming up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter.	85	88
take	DYNAMIC	In his book The Symposium, Plato wrote “Those who are halves of a man whole pursue males, and being slices, so to speak, of the male, love men throughout their boyhood, and take pleasure in physical contact with men” (qtd.	173	176
considered	STATIVE	In fact, Plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only “real and lasting love” and necessary for democracy.	20	29
considered	STATIVE	Even Homer wrote about Achilles and Patroclus, who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love (Emond).	61	70
describe	DYNAMIC	But it was not until 1869 that the term “homosexual” was first used, to describe “a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex” (Marcus 1).	72	79
looked	STATIVE	(However, for the purposes of this paper, homosexuality will be looked at solely in terms of men).	64	69
derived	DYNAMIC	Kertbeny derived this word from the Greek word for “same” and the Latin word for “sex,” whereas a heterosexual is a person” whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex” (Marcus 1).	9	15
opened	DYNAMIC	He became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology, and furthered this position when he opened the world’s first sexological institute, the institute for Sexual Science in Berlin, in 1919, which was destroyed by the Nazis 15 years later.	96	101
defined	STATIVE	This theory, which defined Urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners, was published in twelve pamphlets by Ulrichs, starting in1864.	19	25
including	STATIVE	However, the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s, including the medical professionals, regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness.	58	66
went	STATIVE	Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a heterosexual psychologist, conducted a ground-breaking study in the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as Freud.	104	107
compared	DYNAMIC	In this courageous experiment, Hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men, half homosexual and half heterosexual.	38	45
treated	DYNAMIC	It stated, rather that homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person, but must still be respected as an individual orientation, and thus treated as one (Resolution on Appropriate Therapeutic Responses to Sexual Orientation).	176	182
found	DYNAMIC	Out of the 56 homosexual males who had identical twins, 29, or approximately 52 % of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual, as compared to only 12, or approximately 22 % of the 54 non-identical twins of homosexual males, and 6, or approximately 11 % of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics.	125	129
attracted	STATIVE	The only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite sex, homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex.	90	98
beat	DYNAMIC	As a homosexual, one risks horrifying their parents, other family members, and friends to the point of losing all contact with them, ruining their career, being condemned by their religion, being beat up for publicly displaying their sexuality, and much much more.	196	199
determined	STATIVE	Both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality (nature vs. nurture) and why, when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew, and similar questions.	38	47
born	DYNAMIC	Dobbens believes that he was born homosexual.	29	32
affect	DYNAMIC	He went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation, it did affect his view of it.	91	96
come	STATIVE	Though he has “always kind of fantasized about getting married [to a female],” these feelings come from his “romantic side, which is different from the sexual side” (Woods).	94	97
caused	STATIVE	Yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics.	49	54
becomes	STATIVE	Therefore, from the evolutionary standpoint, homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits.	59	65
caused	STATIVE	Since neither of these events have yet taken place, it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene (Fulkerson).	98	103
led	DYNAMIC	My findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality.	40	42
do	STATIVE	No one knows for sure now (although many think they do), and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth.	52	55
determine	STATIVE	However this does not necessarily determine a homosexual; rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors.	34	42

going	STATIVE	“I don’t know … it was going to be just us tonight.	23	27
offering	DYNAMIC	It seemed like tonight’s darkness was small and personal, cupped hands offering a place for two, not the burning, open darkness of a rave.	71	78

comes	DYNAMIC	Even the city feels alive when spring comes.”	38	44
shake	STATIVE	We slammed against the doorway and I was laughing too, the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest, Rachel in my arms because she’d used me to soften her landing.	81	85
stripped	STATIVE	The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ’s toolkit and his beer.	27	34

looking	STATIVE	Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn’t see anyone else there.	40	46
split	DYNAMIC	The next time the crowd split, I saw him.	24	29
wore	STATIVE	He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin.	3	6

called	DYNAMIC	I called Mitch and our other friends, hoping that she’d crashed at one of their houses, but I had no luck.	2	7
miss	DYNAMIC	I didn’t know how they could miss such exotic features, even in that distorting light.	29	32

parked	STATIVE	“Is it really safe to leave the car …” he was already walking toward the squat, brick-windowed building we were parked next to.	112	117
opened	STATIVE	Inside, the building opened up.	21	26
looked	STATIVE	It looked like we were in the back of a nightclub.	3	8
looked	DYNAMIC	Then I looked down and saw what had let us in.	7	12
held	DYNAMIC	What up?” The hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap.	46	49
looked	STATIVE	It almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly.	10	15
remembered	STATIVE	That’s why I couldn’t understand why no-one else remembered him.	49	58
seen	DYNAMIC	Have you seen anyone like that in your club?”	9	12
bet	STATIVE	If this cat’s for real, I bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know.”	26	28
looked	DYNAMIC	Back on the street, I began to see things that I had never looked for until then.	59	64
looked	STATIVE	A corpulent, batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle.	74	79
expanded	DYNAMIC	I noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills.	40	47
is	DYNAMIC	Love-ins, raves, gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion: that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over, and that is where Rachel met someone from this world.	42	43

forced	DYNAMIC	I caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye.	23	28
got	STATIVE	“You’ve got a deal.	8	10
headed	DYNAMIC	As we headed down the sidewalk, I said, “What is your name, anyway?”	6	11
inspire	DYNAMIC	Walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other, he did not inspire confidence.	111	117
face	DYNAMIC	“Just at this corner,” he said, interrupting my immanent panic attack, “we’re going to stop and turn three times widdersh – er, counterclockwise, then face east.	151	154
appeared	DYNAMIC	When it had all burnt, a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner.	53	60
place	DYNAMIC	Spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon, rosemary, and scents I couldn’t place.	85	90
rose	DYNAMIC	Its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart, and with its long, many-shouldered pole of a torso, it rose over our heads even while seated.	153	156
told	STATIVE	“We’re not here to browse,” Nepthys told him.	36	39
frowned	DYNAMIC	The thing frowned.	10	17
obliged	STATIVE	Please, if we could see him, we would be much obliged.	46	53
imagine	STATIVE	I imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons.”	2	8
looked	DYNAMIC	Step behind the cart and enter through the door there, using your left hand to open the door and your right – ” he looked at me “ – to close it.”	115	120

said	STATIVE	“We’re here for information about a vampire,” said Nepthys.	46	49

allow	DYNAMIC	It would allow me to leave this bed, despite my current illness.	9	13
assured	DYNAMIC	“Of course we will fetch you the stone,” Nepthys assured him.	49	55
looked	STATIVE	Instead, it looked like we were in the red-light district: women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys.	12	17
insulted	STATIVE	Sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive.	41	48
working	DYNAMIC	The next room had mosaics of what could have been Rome, with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd, floppy hats on the other.	82	88
barred	STATIVE	After this, we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside.	66	71
ignoring	DYNAMIC	“Excuse me,” I said, ignoring Nepthys’ warning look, “but may I ask what is kept in these rooms?”	21	28
barred	STATIVE	The woman paused before another door, this one not barred but locked.	51	56
deal	DYNAMIC	As she brought out the key, she said, “We deal mostly in fairly mundane trades, but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items.	42	45

interrupted	STATIVE	“As if I wanted it,” interrupted the woman.	21	31
thought	DYNAMIC	I thought about it, then nodded.	2	8
sat	DYNAMIC	There was a wooden chair, where she sat me down and asked me to wait.	36	38
finished	DYNAMIC	We’ll be done with them before your hair is finished.” Then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber.	44	53
admonished	STATIVE	“Be careful you don’t let him touch it until you’re ready to use it,” the woman admonished Nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him.	80	89
sat	DYNAMIC	“Vodka, straight up,” Nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter, “and a Bloody Mary for my friend.	55	57
run	DYNAMIC	“You could run on empty with a little of that stuff.	11	13
thought	DYNAMIC	He thought about that.	3	9
figure	STATIVE	“You figure they’re some Lincoln-green pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory, right?	5	10
show	DYNAMIC	Here, they’re the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the ‘gritty ambience’ – you have them in your world, too, right?	34	37
stick	STATIVE	When the Russian government dammed the river, my parents decided that instead of dying with the river, they would stick with the people of the village they’d protected.	114	118
born	DYNAMIC	I was born here, and I was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river.	6	9
miss	STATIVE	Sure, I miss having a place to settle down, but it’s better than waiting to get dammed.” He took another shot of vodka.	8	11
looks	STATIVE	I want to see what a magic stone looks like.	33	37
thought	DYNAMIC	He thought about it, then handed me the pouch.	3	9
looked	STATIVE	It looked like a normal river stone, a gray oval with a white stripe through it.	3	8
looked	DYNAMIC	As long as I looked at it, it didn’t reveal any magic sparkle or glow.	13	18
looked	STATIVE	Suddenly, what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me.	15	20
felt	DYNAMIC	Immediately, I felt it grow warm and knew that I had done something very stupid.	15	18
felt	DYNAMIC	Then there was light, a kind of rosy glow, and I felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air.	49	52
does	DYNAMIC	“Do you know what this thing does?” I shouted, hardly able to hear myself.	29	34
looked	STATIVE	Nepthys was saying something that looked like, “I have no idea!” but I couldn’t hear him.	34	39
got	DYNAMIC	“I think I understand why we got that stone from a slave shop,” said Nepthys.	29	31
looked	DYNAMIC	Nepthys looked at me incredulously.	8	13
lit	DYNAMIC	The vendor stared a little at Amy, his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stand’s little lamp, but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs.	68	70
thought	DYNAMIC	I should say, set yourself back, since it’s your girlfriend we’re looking for.” I thought about Rachel; in the excitement, I had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts.	82	88
held	DYNAMIC	Come on, we’re heading out.” He held the door for me and Amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs.	32	35
shocked	STATIVE	Walking outside, I was shocked to see that it was already dark.	23	29
comes	DYNAMIC	“Night comes quickly here,” said Nepthys quietly as he came out behind me.	7	11
look	STATIVE	You look ridiculous with a shaved head.” At a nearby stand, he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real Boston.	4	7
read	STATIVE	It was a black baseball cap that read “Dead Can Dance” in gold across the front.	33	36
named	DYNAMIC	She still hadn’t spoken since I named her, so I wasn’t sure.	32	36
bulged	STATIVE	He took us to a squat, long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal.	48	53
sounded	STATIVE	From behind him, I could hear something that sounded like a remix of the Cure’s “A Forest”.	45	51
staring	STATIVE	I shivered as I walked past the pale man’s blank eyes, wondering what they were staring at.	80	86
thought	DYNAMIC	I thought that I saw one rib shift in its setting, like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall, but when I turned, it was still.	2	8
looked	STATIVE	As she rose, her robes fell open and I realized that, except for what looked like a red silk kimono, she was naked – naked and stunning.	70	75
offering	DYNAMIC	“And I am Isis,” said the woman, offering her hand to me.	33	40
filled	DYNAMIC	The wine’s rich scent had a touch of something chemical that I recognized from the bar, but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth.	95	100

rested	DYNAMIC	Isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while I spoke and tried not to stare at her full, hanging breasts.	35	40

looking	STATIVE	Amy leaned forward, looking amazed.	20	26
reflected	DYNAMIC	The glow reflected on her pink face, casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeat-strong cheeks.	9	17
swept	DYNAMIC	Shivers swept through her body, and Nepthys reached out to touch her but I stopped him.	8	12
crossed	STATIVE	She rolled onto her back, her arms crossed tightly over her chest.	35	41
looked	STATIVE	For the first time, she looked vulnerable.	24	29
had	DYNAMIC	When she finally spoke, I had to lean close to hear her.	26	28
look	DYNAMIC	You should look for him at Dvorov’s as quickly as you can.” She turned to me with tired sympathy.	11	14

stood	DYNAMIC	I stood, and one of her servants took me and Amy to the door.	2	7
looked	DYNAMIC	I looked back to see Nepthys whispering something to her.	2	7
stood	DYNAMIC	He stood to go, but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment.	3	7
waiting	DYNAMIC	When we got there, another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood.	44	50
looked	DYNAMIC	“That was very kind of her.” Closing the box, he paused beside the open door and looked back at me.	81	86
looked	STATIVE	It looked like he was going to continue, but then he walked out the door.	3	8
said	STATIVE	“I know a quick way to Dvorov’s,” said Nepthys.	34	37
bet	DYNAMIC	“I bet he’s kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me.” In a few minutes, we were back to the first door we’d knocked on in this town and Dvorov himself was greeting us.	3	5
look	STATIVE	I mean, he is kinda tight about that stuff.” He didn’t look very surprised.	55	58
looked	STATIVE	Something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd, which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before.	79	84
filled	DYNAMIC	My nose filled with a reek of thick sweat.	8	13
hiding	DYNAMIC	Somewhere toward the center of the dance floor, I heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing – for a second, I was back with my family in Russia, hiding from the cold.	157	162
stretched	DYNAMIC	As it started to rise, a man with thick, scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him.	53	61
clutching	DYNAMIC	A cold thing with countless, writhing tentacles fell against me, thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose, tripping me and clutching at my limbs.	131	139
seen	DYNAMIC	The creature blocking my vision moved back, but I had seen all that I needed to see.	54	57
called	DYNAMIC	“Yes,” I called back, “I saw him!	9	14
separated	STATIVE	On the floor was Dvorov’s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood.	32	40
bet	DYNAMIC	I bet his hide-out is nearby, too.	2	4
sheathed	DYNAMIC	Let’s hurry.” He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip.	41	48
keeping	STATIVE	We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us.	25	31
called	DYNAMIC	I called out to Amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us.	2	7
looked	STATIVE	Inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for DJ equipment.	28	33
urged	DYNAMIC	Nepthys urged me on from the back of the room, then made a turn out of sight.	8	12
imagine	DYNAMIC	I didn’t imagine that Nepthys had done it, and it wasn’t without alarm that I ran after him.	9	15
rose	STATIVE	The vault rose into obscurity above me, and a massive rose window stood ahead of me.	10	13
looked	STATIVE	The panes looked dyed black, and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter.	10	15
reflected	DYNAMIC	Footsteps echoed through the stone chamber, and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere.	58	66
held	DYNAMIC	I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face.	34	37
held	DYNAMIC	His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards.	87	90
felt	DYNAMIC	The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw.	74	77
perceive	STATIVE	I could perceive Nepthys’ sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone.	8	15
felt	DYNAMIC	I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral’s hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek.	136	139
felt	DYNAMIC	A girl’s voice, soft and almost recognizable, spoke, “Nathan.” I felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected.	65	68
stood	DYNAMIC	I stood and turned toward the altar.	2	6
giving	DYNAMIC	I pulled the vial of liquid that he’d been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar.	43	48
sat	DYNAMIC	Allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close.	6	8
crowded	STATIVE	Allan unfolded another page, this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right.	38	44
lay	STATIVE	The lines of letters stepped into their divisions, in the shape of a story's outline: the loose, dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet, awaiting tendons, muscle and blushing skin.	120	122
prepared	STATIVE	Allan reviewed the troops, all prepared to disembark, their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from Life Abroad to find his childhood friend a bride to-be, thus upsetting the apple cart of his life's plan, clarified – of course – by his very time away from her he loved best.	31	38
thought	DYNAMIC	Perhaps this will be more saleable, he thought and began to write.	39	45
thought	DYNAMIC	This is good, he thought, pausing to raise the low light of the lantern.	17	24
done	STATIVE	I'm almost done, and the happy ending is just falling into place.	11	15
dare	DYNAMIC	I hardly dare to think it, but – I may finish this story!	9	12
framed	DYNAMIC	Its thin, drawn fingers framed the bloated moon, whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly.	24	29
held	DYNAMIC	He held a hand to his forehead, eyes closed and face flushed.	3	6
thought	DYNAMIC	I did it again, he thought.	19	26
face	STATIVE	His face soft as if caught between a smile and tears, he draped his loose cape over her shoulders.	4	7
felt	STATIVE	They stepped together into his carriage, her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt, conveyed as if through her skin, the unearthly nature of the rails and reins, the wheelspokes.	89	93
mounted	DYNAMIC	The New England woods disappeared, even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky.	95	101
crushed	DYNAMIC	Allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window.	6	12
sat	DYNAMIC	The next day, Allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a well-furnished parlor.	20	22
had	DYNAMIC	I had a perfect story in my pages; my hero returned home and reclaimed his love, I nearly had it tied together before…	2	4
assumed	STATIVE	Arthur's face assumed a long-suffering aspect of authoritative exasperation.	14	20
lies	STATIVE	"This is more like a compulsion, a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment, then leaps and takes ahold of me, screaming out through my quill."""	45	48
enjoy	STATIVE	"Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy.	Arthur raised a critical brow. Perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy. Every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal; and believe me, Allan, you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish. There simply is no audience for fairy tales – no literate audience, at least."""	111	116
forced	DYNAMIC	"My prodigal ink-blooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road."""	65	70
listening	STATIVE	"It's hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print, like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd."""	17	25
hung	DYNAMIC	Allan hung his head, holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees.	6	9
consider	STATIVE	"I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off.	Perhaps it would,"" Allan replied, rising and vainly straightening his suit. ""I shall consider it; in the meantime, however, I must be off. You have been a gracious host, as always."""	8	15
collecting	DYNAMIC	He walked the wheel-ruts, hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust.	66	75
called	DYNAMIC	he called out to the empty road.	3	8
wait	DYNAMIC	"I had a hunch you'd be at Arthur's today, said Nathan, ""so I thought I'd wait here for you."""	73	76
fit	STATIVE	Nathan's lanky frame, dressed in a loose, tan jacket, fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton.	54	56
fell	STATIVE	His hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface, infusing his body with a rakish energy.	9	12
finished	STATIVE	"Yes, it is finished!	Yes, it is finished! Ended! Never again shall it see the rosy-fingered dawn! Nathan, you've read these abominations of mine. You know just as well as I that they have no future, no potential. At best, they are faery tales; at worst, expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see."""	11	19
set	STATIVE	"I want to write as others do: a tale, set in our real world, of characters who might live therein, not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars!"""	38	40
be	DYNAMIC	If you never finish such stories, how can they be worth publishing?	47	48
is	DYNAMIC	That is precisely why I must excise this malignant instinct!	5	6
face	DYNAMIC	"You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter, though you face such difficulty.	You choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter, though you face such difficulty. Why is that?"""	78	81
continued	DYNAMIC	Ignoring the statement, Nathan continued.	31	40
embrace	STATIVE	Since you seem unable to write 'normally,' why not embrace your tales as they are, leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure?	51	57
speak	STATIVE	"You need not pander to what you imagine their wants are; speak, and they shall listen."""	57	62
crouched	DYNAMIC	Allan crouched over his desk once more, pen in hand and mind blank.	6	13
constructed	DYNAMIC	He contemplated a story, an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago.	55	65
filled	DYNAMIC	He had filled his pen and raised it, the nib descending towards the paper, before the sound came: the gentle, persistent tapping of the gnarled, primeval willow touching the window with long, insistent fingers.	7	12
raising	DYNAMIC	He shook the papers at Allan, raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son.	30	36
looked	DYNAMIC	Arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author, viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was Arthur Mason.	7	12
hold	STATIVE	"If you insist on abandoning me, I shall not hold you."""	44	47
making	DYNAMIC	He then turned and left through the door opposite that Arthur had taken, making his way past his host's doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards Nathan's residence, several miles away.	73	78
sat	STATIVE	Allan sat nervously across from him in a chair Nathan had probably upholstered himself, a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period.	6	8
written	DYNAMIC	It's the best story you've ever written.	32	39
felt	STATIVE	Allan, though dubious as to that possibility, felt some temptation from the compliment; mainly, it granted him the encouragement he still needed.	46	49
felt	STATIVE	He felt now that perhaps Nathan was right; although the man was somewhat peculiar, he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight.	3	6
found	STATIVE	His mind's strangest fruit had ripened at last, and he found the taste less bitter than expected.	55	59
burned	STATIVE	It was evening, and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last.	28	33
filled	STATIVE	Passionate, fiery colors filled the western sky before him, though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead.	25	30
distinguished	DYNAMIC	As Allan drew closer, he distinguished a new cloud, a pillar rising directly ahead; a road of smoke ascended in the west, its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door.	25	37
scattered	DYNAMIC	Allan's thoughts fled as one, scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume.	60	68
following	DYNAMIC	As they trotted forth, Allan's eyes remained trapped by the carriage, following it up the hillock and past himself.	70	78
drawn	DYNAMIC	The heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows.	28	32
gone	DYNAMIC	When they had gone, he remained, stunned, until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself.	14	18
ran	STATIVE	In a thoughtless panic, Allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre.	54	56
threatened	DYNAMIC	His handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn, burning logs, but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes, tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers.	151	160
considered	DYNAMIC	Instead, he bethought himself of the loss of the tree; considered also Arthur's motivation and whether some good might not come of this, after all.	55	64
stood	DYNAMIC	Leaving the circle of ashes, he stood and turned towards the woods, in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood.	32	36
saw	STATIVE	And without that torturous willow, he might be free to write whatever he saw fit.	73	75
leaves	STATIVE	As it turned to the deeper woods, elder giants rose above him: a beech, smooth bark a gray-green pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark, cracked trunks of the nearer trees; great pines, a few magnificent specimens still bearing the three-stroke symbol of the British King; a towering black birch, leaves impossibly high above him.	319	324
continued	DYNAMIC	As the stream wound its way through the largest pines, grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings, Allan continued, slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants.	177	186
grew	STATIVE	Before him, roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream, grew a stand of black willows.	58	61
wrapped	DYNAMIC	Collapsing at its base, Allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan, a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks, falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream, flowing through the ground beneath them.	30	36
identified	DYNAMIC	The President's military aide, an Air Force officer, quickly researched the options and, sometime around 10:20, identified Barksdale Air Force Base as an appropriate interim destination.	112	121
were	DYNAMIC	When Air Force One landed at Barksdale at about 11:45, personnel from the localSecret Service office were still en route to the airfield.	101	104
recommended	DYNAMIC	The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed.	66	76
accommodate	STATIVE	Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and control facilities, and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 50 persons.	123	133
spend	DYNAMIC	The Secret Service wanted a place where the President could spend several days, if necessary.	60	64
pointed	STATIVE	"Rice said President Bush began the meeting with the words, ""We're at war,"" and that Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet saidthe agency was still assessing who was responsible, but the early signs all pointed to al Qaeda."	210	216

met	STATIVE	On the morning of September 13, the national airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security standards.	88	90
aided	STATIVE	After extraordinary emergency efforts involving the White House, the Treasury Department, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually competitive firms of the financial industry, the markets reopened on Monday, September 17.	134	138
following	DYNAMIC	INS attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections; in the chaos after the attacks, it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials, who were following up on other leads.	248	256
held	DYNAMIC	The detaineeswere lawfully held on immigration charges.	27	30
found	DYNAMIC	The inspector general of the Justice Department found significant problems in the way the 9/11 detainees were treated.	48	52
including	DYNAMIC	A senior al Qaeda detainee has stated that U.S. government efforts after the 9/11attacks to monitor the American homeland, including review of Muslims' immigration files and deportation of nonpermanent residents, forced al Qaeda to operate less freely in the United States.	123	131

described	DYNAMIC	Vice President Cheney described the President's mood as somber.	22	30
chaired	DYNAMIC	"When the larger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up, President Bush chaired a smaller meeting of top advisers, a group he would later call his ""war council."""	93	99
included	STATIVE	This group usually included Vice President Cheney, Secretary of State Powell, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, General Hugh Shelton, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (later to become chairman) General Myers, DCI Tenet, Attorney General Ashcroft, and FBI Director Robert Mueller.	19	26
had	DYNAMIC	Secretary Powell said the United States had to make it clear to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Arab states that the time to act was now.	40	42
provided	STATIVE	The President noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage Russia and China.	37	44
supporting	DYNAMIC	The principals agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al Qaeda would risk harm.	69	78

making	DYNAMIC	Musharraf said the GOP [government of Pakistan] was making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would pay a domestic price.	52	57
benefiting	DYNAMIC	"To counterbalance that he needed to show that Pakistan was benefiting from his decisions."""	59	68
focus	DYNAMIC	He made clear that the military should focus on targets that would influence the Taliban's behavior.	39	43
titled	DYNAMIC	"President Bush also tasked the State Department, which on the following day deliveredto the White House a paper titled ""Game Plan for a Political- Military Strategy for Pakistan and Afghanistan."""	112	117
plan	DYNAMIC	Therefore, State and Defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into Afghanistan.	35	38
according	STATIVE	Both departments would consult with NATO and other allies and request intelligence, basing, and other support from countries, according to their capabilities and resources.	126	134
detailed	STATIVE	Finally, the plan detailed a public U.S. stance: America would use all its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat, punish those responsible for the 9/11 attacks, hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to terrorists, work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks, and avoid malice toward any people, religion, or culture.	18	25
did	STATIVE	The existing Infinite Resolve options did not, in his view, amount to such a plan.	38	40
described	DYNAMIC	Tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations.	6	14
act	DYNAMIC	These CIA teams would act jointly with the military's Special Operations units.	22	24
praised	DYNAMIC	President Bush later praised this proposal, saying it had been a turning point in his thinking.	21	27
drew	STATIVE	"It drew on the Infinite Resolve ""phased campaign"" plan the Pentagon had begun developing in November 2000 as an addition to the strike options it had been refining since 1998."	3	6
charged	DYNAMIC	In a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting,President Bush charged Ashcroft, Mueller, and Tenet to develop a plan for homeland defense.	92	98

titled	STATIVE	"The pre-9/11 draft presidential directive on al Qaeda evolved into a new directive,National Security Presidential Directive 9, now titled ""Defeating the Terrorist Threat to the United States."""	131	136
extend	STATIVE	The directive would now extend to a global war on terrorism, not just on al Qaeda.	24	29
incorporated	STATIVE	It also incorporated the President's determination not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them.	8	19
wondered	DYNAMIC	President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam Hussein'sregime might have had a hand in it.	19	26
engaged	STATIVE	Iraq had been an enemy of the United States for 11 years, and was the only place in the world where the United States was engaged in ongoing combat operations.	122	128
struck	STATIVE	As a former pilot, the President was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting, especially Hanjour's high-speed dive into the Pentagon.	37	42
written	DYNAMIC	Clarke has written that on the evening of September 12, President Bush told him andsome of his staff to explore possible Iraqi links to 9/11.	11	17
recalls	STATIVE	"See if Saddam did this, Clarke recalls the President telling them."""	31	37
acknowledged	STATIVE	While he believed the details of Clarke's account to be incorrect, President Bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to Clarke at some point, asking him about Iraq.	82	93
titled	STATIVE	"Responding to a presidential tasking, Clarke's office sent a memo to Rice onSeptember 18, titled ""Survey of Intelligence Information on Any Iraq Involvement in the September 11 Attacks."""	90	95
pointed	STATIVE	Arguing that the case for links between Iraq and al Qaeda was weak, the memo pointed out that Bin Ladin resented the secularism of Saddam Hussein's regime.	77	83
said	STATIVE	Finally, the memo said, there was no confirmed reporting on Saddam cooperating with Bin Ladin on unconventional weapons.	18	22
according	STATIVE	On the afternoon of 9/11, according to contemporaneous notes, Secretary Rumsfeldinstructed General Myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible.	26	34
indicate	STATIVE	The notes indicate that he also told Myers that he was not simply interested in striking empty training sites.	10	17
consider	STATIVE	He thought the U.S. response should consider a wide range of options and possibilities.	36	43
considering	STATIVE	Secretary Rumsfeld later explained that at the time, he had been considering either one of them, or perhaps someone else, as the responsible party.	65	75
specified	STATIVE	A Defense Department paper for the Camp David briefing book on the strategic conceptfor the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action: al Qaeda, theTaliban, and Iraq.	109	117
cited	STATIVE	Iraq's long-standing involvement in terrorism was cited, along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction.	50	55
had	DYNAMIC	"Paul was always of the view that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with, Powell told us."""	57	59
saw	STATIVE	"And he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to deal with the Iraq problem."""	7	9
dealt	STATIVE	Iraq was not even on the table during the September 15 afternoon session, which dealt solely with Afghanistan.	80	84
called	DYNAMIC	Rice said that when President Bush called her on Sunday, September 16, he said thefocus would be on Afghanistan, although he still wanted plans for Iraq should the country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been involved in the 9/11 attacks.	35	40
continued	DYNAMIC	Within the Pentagon, Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz continued to press the case fordealing with Iraq.	48	56
contended	DYNAMIC	"Wolfowitz contended that the odds were ""far more"" than 1 in 10, citing Saddam's praise for the attack, his long record of involvement in terrorism, and theories that Ramzi Yousef was an Iraqi agent and Iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center."	10	18
named	DYNAMIC	Though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the conflict, the references to specific enemies or regions named only the Taliban, al Qaeda, and Afghanistan.	105	109
expressed	DYNAMIC	Some members of his administration, he commented, had expressed a different view, but he was the one responsible for making the decisions.	54	62
arguing	DYNAMIC	Franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning onmilitary responses in Iraq during the summer before 9/11-a request President Bush denied, arguing that the time was not right.	168	174
issued	DYNAMIC	"Having issued directives to guide his administration's preparations for war, onThursday, September 20, President Bush addressed the nation before a joint session of Congress."""	7	12
share	DYNAMIC	"They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate."""	49	53

went	STATIVE	"President Bush argued that the new war went beyond Bin Ladin."""	39	42
approved	DYNAMIC	President Bush approved military plans to attack Afghanistan in meetings with CentralCommand's General Franks and other advisers on September 21 and October 2.	15	22
opposed	STATIVE	In an innovative joint effort, CIA and Special Operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major Afghan faction opposed to the Taliban.	131	137
were	DYNAMIC	The basing arrangements contemplated for Phase One were substantially secured-after arduous effort-by the end of that month.	51	54
installed	DYNAMIC	On December 22, Hamid Karzai, a Pashtun leader from Kandahar, was installed as the chairman of Afghanistan's interim administration.	66	74
look	STATIVE	I look forward to working with you to develop such an approach to reduce emissions from power generation.	2	5
applaud	DYNAMIC	We applaud Senator Jeffords for tackling this important issue and for recognizing that a cap and trade program is the best way to achieve these reductions.	3	9
suggests	STATIVE	Our analysis to date suggests that it could increase consumers' electricity rates by as much as 50%, which we believe is unacceptable.	21	28
increased	DYNAMIC	During this time, gross domestic product has increased almost 160%.	45	53
save	STATIVE	Units that reduce their emissions below the number of allowances they hold may trade allowances with other units in the system, sell them to other sources or save them for future use.	158	161
provides	STATIVE	Allowance trading provides incentives for energy conservation and technology innovation that can both lower the cost of compliance and yield pollution prevention benefits.	18	25
encourages	STATIVE	The association of a monetary value with reduced emissions encourages innovation: in the 1990's, scrubber costs decreased by approximately 40% and scrubber sulfur removal efficiencies improved from 90% to 95%, and experimentation led to the blending of fuels to lower emissions.	59	68
reduced	DYNAMIC	Compliance with the program has been nearly 100 percent and annual emissions of SO2 from power plants have already been reduced over 6 million tons (about 35 percent) from 1980 levels.	120	126
reduced	DYNAMIC	"Acid rain levels were dramatically reduced over large areas of the U.S. and trading did not result in geographic shifting of emissions, or ""hot spots"", as some feared."	35	41
continue	STATIVE	Problems associated with sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and mercury emissions are of national and international significance, and the interstate and long range transport of emissions continue to play significant roles in the nature and magnitude of the problems.	197	204
born	STATIVE	Children born to women who consume large amounts of mercury-contaminated fish while pregnant may be at risk for neurodevelopmental defects.	9	12
affecting	DYNAMIC	• SO2 and NOx contribute to acid deposition, which damages lakes and streams, adversely affecting the fish and other species that live in them, and leaches nutrients from the soil.	88	96
continue	STATIVE	Despite significant improvements in air quality throughout the country however, emissions from power generation continue to result in serious health, environmental and economic impacts.	112	119
stands	STATIVE	The President's flexible, market-based approach to reducing emissions from power generators stands in sharp contrast to the complex web of existing regulations which currently confront the industry.	92	97
address	STATIVE	These regulations include both federal and State requirements that address a variety of emissions including SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, and a number of hazardous air pollutants.	67	73
end	STATIVE	But the regulation of power generators does not end with existing regulations.	48	50
shows	DYNAMIC	Modeling shows that when full implementation of existing regulations such as the acid rain program, the NOx SIP Call, the Tier II standards for cars and trucks, the heavy duty diesel engine standards, and the low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel rules are taken into account, additional reductions will be needed to bring areas into attainment.	9	13
have	DYNAMIC	Because states and EPA will have to find some way to significantly reduce NOx and SO2 emissions, it is probable that power generators will be required to reduce their emissions significantly.	28	31
shows	STATIVE	Power generation accounts for a significant percentage of these emissions, and our analysis shows that there are significant reductions available at lower cost than from other sources.	92	96
adopted	STATIVE	EPA's requirement, adopted in response to section 126 petitions, that sources in a number of eastern states reduce NOx emissions was recently upheld by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.	19	25
anticipate	STATIVE	Since states now know that EPA has authority to address transport pollution through responses to 126 petitions or by issuing a rule like the NOx SIP Call, we anticipate that states will be turning to these types of control approaches early in the SIP process.	158	167
are	DYNAMIC	With most plants needing to install control equipment to meet these requirements, it is likely that this approach would lead to installation of controls that become obsolete and stranded capital investments as additional requirements are promulgated.	234	236
exacerbated	STATIVE	These factors are exacerbated by limited timeframes that may constrain available compliance options and thwart long range planning.	18	28
point	STATIVE	These and other inefficiencies point to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that could reduce cost while improving environmental progress and accountability.	31	35
build	STATIVE	It will build on the successes of the Acid Rain cap and trade program.	8	12
compared	STATIVE	Up-front knowledge of future requirements for multiple pollutants would lead firms to follow significantly different and less expensive compliance strategies at individual plants, compared with compliance choices which must be made as requirements are addressed in a sequential manner under the current law.	180	187
come	STATIVE	"The savings come from the opportunity to make cost-effective plant investment and retirement decisions with full knowledge of upcoming SO2, NOx and mercury requirements, rather than investing in ""add-on"" control equipment to meet the requirements of each regulation."	12	15
provide	DYNAMIC	An integrated package of measures that addresses both the existing regulatory requirements as well as many future environmental needs would provide the greatest degree of certainty and flexibility for the industry, while achieving the necessary emission reductions at lower cost than under current law.	140	146
provide	STATIVE	A national cap and trade program with appropriate caps for NOx and SO2 could provide the emission reductions necessary to bring a significant number of areas into attainment with the ozone and fine particle standards.	77	83
administered	STATIVE	Additionally, the Acid Rain cap and trade program is administered with a relatively small staff relying on strong, state-of-the-art data tracking and reporting capabilities.	53	64
ensure	STATIVE	Caps ensure that environmental goals are met.	5	10
protects	STATIVE	A cap that represents significant reductions of emissions protects the environment by reducing overall loadings.	58	65
recommended	DYNAMIC	"Therefore, the National Energy Plan recommended that the Administration's approach include appropriate measures to address local concerns, such as the unlikely occurrence of an SO2 ""hot spot"" or area of concentrated emissions."	36	46
go	STATIVE	Significant reductions will go a long way towards addressing local concerns.	28	29
seen	DYNAMIC	Under the Acid Rain cap and trade program, we have not seen local hot spots because the highest emitters are often the most cost-effective to control and therefore, the most likely to control.	55	58
advanced	DYNAMIC	The NEP goals of increasing energy supplies, accelerating the protection and improvement of the environment, and increasing our nation's energy supply must be advanced.	159	167
maintained	DYNAMIC	In particular, to prevent the reoccurrence of energy shortages and price volatility, a diverse mix of fuel sources should be maintained.	125	135
applaud	STATIVE	We applaud your acknowledgment of market-based incentives, particularly cap and trade systems, as a powerful tool in environmental protection.	3	9
builds	STATIVE	In this way, S. 556 builds on successful elements of the Clean Air Act.	20	25
do	STATIVE	We do, however, oppose S. 556 because of concerns with the bill -- both with some provisions that are in the bill and with some that are missing.	3	5
endanger	STATIVE	We believe the emission reductions and timing in the bill will be too costly for consumers and will endanger national energy security.	100	107
force	DYNAMIC	The abbreviated time frame would force many generators to make these retrofits simultaneously.	33	37
limits	STATIVE	When you have a hard cap, as you would under S. 556, requiring emission reductions at a specific source does not reduce the overall level of pollution, it just limits industry's flexibility about where to make the reductions.	160	165
depending	STATIVE	For example, depending on the ultimate cap levels chosen by Congress, this type of legislation would obviate the need for Best Available Retrofit Technology requirements, mercury MACT, and new source review case-by-case technology requirements for power generators.	13	21
increasing	DYNAMIC	Pursuing sharp reductions in CO2 from the electricity generating sector alone would cause a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas and thus would run the risk of endangering national energy security, substantially increasing energy prices and harming consumers.	215	224
pose	STATIVE	However, CO2 has never been regulated as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and does not pose any direct threat to human health unlike NOx, SO2 and mercury.	90	93
provide	STATIVE	The current body of scientific knowledge does not provide information regarding atmospheric concentrations of CO2 or reduction levels necessary to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system.	50	56
provided	DYNAMIC	In April, the President convened a Cabinet-level policy review of this issue and was provided with initial recommendations that he accepted and announced on June 11.	85	92
spends	DYNAMIC	The United States now spends $1.6 billion annually on climate science to reduce uncertainties - a commitment unmatched by any other nation.	22	27
lies	STATIVE	"The ""National Climate Change Technology Initiative"" will accelerate priority research and the application of advanced energy and sequestration technologies, recognizing that the real answer to addressing climate change in the long term lies in the development and global introduction of such technologies in this century."	236	239
projected	STATIVE	Finally, as greenhouse gas emissions are projected to grow exponentially in the developing world in the next two decades, we must evaluate the costs of imposing domestic reductions as a very high cost against potentially low-cost opportunities for mitigating and sequestering carbon emissions in the developing world.	41	49
look	STATIVE	I look forward to the additional hearings you will need to address these important issues and to working with the Committee to develop an approach that the President can support.	2	5
made	STATIVE	The history of Clean Air Act legislation is one of great accomplishments made possible by bipartisan efforts.	73	76
thank	DYNAMIC	I thank you for the opportunity to work with you to continue that great tradition.	2	6
called	DYNAMIC	The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission has been called upon to examine the financial and economic crisis that has gripped our country and explain its causes to the American people.	49	54
present	DYNAMIC	Here we present our conclusions.	8	14
gathered	STATIVE	We encourage the American people to join us in making their own assessments based on the evidence gathered in our inquiry.	98	105
present	STATIVE	To help our fellow citizens better understand this crisis and its causes, we also present specific conclusions at the end of chapters in Parts III, IV, and V of this report.	82	88
swept	STATIVE	Nearly $11 trillion in household wealth has vanished, with retirement accounts and life savings swept away.	96	100
felt	DYNAMIC	Businesses, large and small, have felt the sting of a deep recession.	34	37
find	STATIVE	Many people who abided by all the rules now find themselves out of work and uncertain about their future prospects.	44	47
faces	STATIVE	And the nation faces no easy path to renewed economic strength.	15	19
written	DYNAMIC	Even at the time of our appointment to this independent panel, much had already been written and said about the crisis.	85	91
affected	DYNAMIC	Yet all of us have been deeply affected by what we have learned in the course of our inquiry.	31	38
borrowed	DYNAMIC	When the bubble burst, hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgage-related securities shook markets as well as financial institutions that had significant exposures to those mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them.	216	223
caused	DYNAMIC	Panic fanned by a lack of transparency of the balance sheets of major financial institutions, coupled with a tangle of interconnections among institutions perceived to be “too big to fail,” caused the credit markets to seize up.	190	195
bears	STATIVE	The financial system we examined bears little resemblance to that of our parents’ generation.	33	37
held	STATIVE	By 2005, the 10 largest U.S. commercial banks held 55% of the industry’s assets, more than double the level held in 1990.	46	49
constituted	STATIVE	On the eve of the crisis in 2006, financial sector profits constituted 27% of all corporate profits in the United States, up from 15% in 1980.	59	69
permitted	DYNAMIC	In addition, the government permitted financial firms to pick their preferred regulators in what became a race to the weakest supervisor.	28	36
accept	STATIVE	Yet we do not accept the view that regulators lacked the power to protect the financial system.	14	19
required	DYNAMIC	To give just three examples: the Securities and Exchange Commission could have required more capital and halted risky practices at the big investment banks.	79	86
continued	DYNAMIC	In case after case after case, regulators continued to rate the institutions they oversaw as safe and sound even in the face of mounting troubles, often downgrading them just before their collapse.	42	50
selling	DYNAMIC	They took on enormous exposures in acquiring and supporting subprime lenders and creating, packaging, repackaging, and selling trillions of dollars in mortgage-related securities, including synthetic financial products.	119	125
rated	DYNAMIC	The CEO of Citigroup told the Commission that a $40 billion position in highly rated mortgage securities would “not in any way have excited my attention,” and the cohead of Citigroup’s investment bank said he spent “a small fraction of 1%” of his time on those securities.	79	83
embraced	DYNAMIC	Financial institutions and credit rating agencies embraced mathematical models as reliable predictors of risks, replacing judgment in too many instances.	50	57
held	STATIVE	You will read, among other things, about AIG senior management’s ignorance of the terms and risks of the company’s $79 billion derivatives exposure to mortgage-related securities; Fannie Mae’s quest for bigger market share, profits, and bonuses, which led it to ramp up its exposure to risky loans and securities as the housing market was peaking; and the costly surprise when Merrill Lynch’s top management realized that the company held $55 billion in “super-senior” and supposedly “super-safe” mortgage-related securities that resulted in billions of dollars in losses.	434	437
borrowed	DYNAMIC	In the years leading up to the crisis, too many financial institutions, as well as too many households, borrowed to the hilt, leaving them vulnerable to financial distress or ruin if the value of their investments declined even modestly.	104	111
had	DYNAMIC	To make matters worse, much of their borrowing was short-term, in the overnight market—meaning the borrowing had to be renewed each and every day.	109	111
combined	STATIVE	For example, by the end of 2007, Fannie’s and Freddie’s combined leverage ratio, including loans they owned and guaranteed, stood at 75 to 1.	56	63
exacerbated	DYNAMIC	The heavy debt taken on by some financial institutions was exacerbated by the risky assets they were acquiring with that debt.	59	69
loaded	DYNAMIC	As the mortgage and real estate markets churned out riskier and riskier loans and securities, many financial institutions loaded up on them.	122	127
held	STATIVE	By the end of 2007, Lehman had amassed $111 billion in commercial and residential real estate holdings and securities, which was almost twice what it held just two years before, and more than four times its total equity.	150	153
combined	STATIVE	Massive, short-term borrowing, combined with obligations unseen by others in the market, heightened the chances the system could rapidly unravel.	31	38
plagued	DYNAMIC	In the early part of the 20th century, we erected a series of protections— the Federal Reserve as a lender of last resort, federal deposit insurance, ample regulations—to provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued America’s banking system in the 19th century.	227	233
permitted	STATIVE	Yet, over the past 30-plus years, we permitted the growth of a shadow banking system—opaque and laden with short- term debt—that rivaled the size of the traditional banking system.	37	45
preceded	DYNAMIC	As part of our charge, it was appropriate to review government actions taken in response to the developing crisis, not just those policies or actions that preceded it, to determine if any of those responses contributed to or exacerbated the crisis.	155	162
concentrated	DYNAMIC	They thought risk had been diversified when, in fact, it had been concentrated.	66	78
responding	DYNAMIC	Time and again, from the spring of 2007 on, policy makers and regulators were caught off guard as the contagion spread, responding on an ad hoc basis with specific programs to put fingers in the dike.	120	129
allowed	DYNAMIC	We had allowed the system to race ahead of our ability to protect it.	7	13
recognize	DYNAMIC	While there was some awareness of, or at least a debate about, the housing bubble, the record reflects that senior public officials did not recognize that a bursting of the bubble could threaten the entire financial system.	140	148
contained	DYNAMIC	Throughout the summer of 2007, both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paul- son offered public assurances that the turmoil in the subprime mortgage markets would be contained.	198	207
invested	STATIVE	When Bear Stearns’s hedge funds, which were heavily invested in mortgage-related securities, imploded in June 2007, the Federal Reserve discussed the implications of the collapse.	52	59
seeking	DYNAMIC	And just a month before Lehman’s collapse, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was still seeking information on the exposures created by Lehman’s more than 900,000 derivatives contracts.	90	96
making	DYNAMIC	In making these observations, we deeply respect and appreciate the efforts made by Secretary Paulson, Chairman Bernanke, and Timothy Geithner, formerly president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and now treasury secretary, and so many others who labored to stabilize our financial system and our economy in the most chaotic and challenging of circumstances.	3	8
exacerbated	DYNAMIC	Unfortunately—as has been the case in past speculative booms and busts—we witnessed an erosion of standards of responsibility and ethics that exacerbated the financial crisis.	142	152
stretched	STATIVE	This was not universal, but these breaches stretched from the ground level to the corporate suites.	43	51
originating	DYNAMIC	As early as September 2004, Countrywide executives recognized that many of the loans they were originating could result in “catastrophic consequences.” Less than a year later, they noted that certain high-risk loans they were making could result not only in foreclosures but also in “financial and reputational catastrophe” for the firm.	95	105
documents	STATIVE	And the report documents that major financial institutions ineffectively sampled loans they were purchasing to package and sell to investors.	15	23
meet	STATIVE	They knew a significant percentage of the sampled loans did not meet their own underwriting standards or those of the originators.	64	67
disclosed	DYNAMIC	The Commission’s review of many prospectuses provided to investors found that this critical information was not disclosed.	112	121
viewed	DYNAMIC	THESE CONCLUSIONS must be viewed in the context of human nature and individual and societal responsibility.	26	31
accept	DYNAMIC	But as a nation, we must also accept responsibility for what we permitted to occur.	30	35
embraced	STATIVE	Collectively, but certainly not unanimously, we acquiesced to or embraced a system, a set of policies and actions, that gave rise to our present predicament.	65	72
render	STATIVE	Here we render our conclusions about specific components of the system that we believe contributed significantly to the financial meltdown.	8	13
lit	DYNAMIC	We conclude collapsing mortgage-lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis.	91	93
including	DYNAMIC	As irresponsible lending, including predatory and fraudulent practices, became more prevalent, the Federal Reserve and other regulators and authorities heard warnings from many quarters.	26	34
caught	STATIVE	And the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, caught up in turf wars, preempted state regulators from reining in abuses.	88	93
concentrated	STATIVE	As it turned out, these losses were concentrated in a set of systemically important financial institutions.	36	47
explains	STATIVE	This report explains the uncontrolled leverage; lack of transparency, capital, and collateral requirements; speculation; interconnections among firms; and concentrations of risk in this market.	12	19
backed	STATIVE	CDS were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value of mortgage-related securities backed by risky loans.	109	114
amplified	DYNAMIC	They amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread them throughout the financial system.	5	13
created	STATIVE	This is apart from how many times these securities may have been referenced in synthetic CDOs created by other firms.	94	100
committed	DYNAMIC	The government ultimately committed more than $180 billion because of concerns that AIG’s collapse would trigger cascading losses throughout the global financial system.	26	34
marketed	DYNAMIC	The mortgage-related securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval.	79	86
posed	DYNAMIC	In this regard, the Commission has endeavored to address key questions posed to us.	71	75
discuss	STATIVE	Here we discuss three: capital availability and excess liquidity, the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the GSEs), and government housing policy.	8	14
leading	STATIVE	First, as to the matter of excess liquidity: in our report, we outline monetary policies and capital flows during the years leading up to the crisis.	124	130
need	DYNAMIC	However, it is the Commission’s conclusion that excess liquidity did not need to cause a crisis.	73	76
outlined	STATIVE	It was the failures outlined above—including the failure to effectively rein in excesses in the mortgage and financial markets—that were the principal causes of this crisis.	20	27
suffered	STATIVE	They suffered from many of the same failures of corporate governance and risk management as the Commission discovered in other financial firms.	5	12
maintained	STATIVE	Importantly, GSE mortgage securities essentially maintained their value throughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses that were central to the financial crisis.	49	58
were	DYNAMIC	While they generated substantial losses, delinquency rates for GSE loans were substantially lower than loans securitized by other financial firms.	73	76
show	STATIVE	For example, data compiled by the Commission for a subset of borrowers with similar credit scores -- scores below 600 -- show that by the end of 2008, GSE mortgages were far less likely to be seriously delinquent than were non-GSE securitized mortgages: 6.2% versus 28.3%.	121	124
determined	DYNAMIC	Based on the evidence and interviews with dozens of individuals involved in this subject area, we determined these goals only contributed marginally to Fannie’s and Freddie’s participation in those mortgages.	98	107
noted	STATIVE	In conducting our inquiry, we took a careful look at HUD’s affordable housing goals, as noted above, and the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).	88	92
matched	STATIVE	Yet the government failed to ensure that the philosophy of opportunity was being matched by the practical realities on the ground.	81	87
been	DYNAMIC	While we have not been charged with making policy recommendations, the very purpose of our report has been to take stock of what happened so we can plot a new course.	18	21
prepared	STATIVE	We also found that a series of choices and actions led us toward a catastrophe for which we were ill prepared.	101	109
provides	STATIVE	These are serious matters that must be addressed and resolved to restore faith in our financial markets, to avoid the next crisis, and to rebuild a system of capital that provides the foundation for a new era of broadly shared prosperity.	171	178
seen	DYNAMIC	The greatest tragedy would be to accept the refrain that no one could have seen this coming and thus nothing could have been done.	75	78
accept	DYNAMIC	If we accept this notion, it will happen again.	6	11
viewed	DYNAMIC	This report should not be viewed as the end of the nation’s examination of this crisis.	26	31
falls	STATIVE	It falls to us to make different choices if we want different results.	3	7
wants	DYNAMIC	"A Developer is someone who wants to build a house in the woods.	A Developer is someone who wants to build a house in the woods."	27	31
does	STATIVE	"A rancher quickly answered, ""Yes, it does."""	37	42
was	DYNAMIC	What he saw was yesterday's paper.	12	14
kept	DYNAMIC	On a recent flight, an elderly passenger kept peering out the window.	41	44
getting	STATIVE	The hard part was getting the cow to sit down on that darn stool!	18	24
states	STATIVE	There is a theory which states that if anyone ever discovers exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more bizarre and inexplicable.	24	29
going	STATIVE	It's October, and an Indian chief thinks it's going to be a cold winter.	46	50
going	STATIVE	To double-check his prediction, the chief calls the National Weather Service and asks a meteorologist if the winter is going to be a cold one.	119	123
According	STATIVE	"The man responds, ""According to our indicators, we think it might."""	18	27
headed	STATIVE	A week later he calls the National Weather Service again, and they confirm that a harsh winter is headed their way.	98	103

following	DYNAMIC	The following dialog ensued:	4	12

sat	STATIVE	Pepsi and hamburgers were judged the modern equivalent, and the student sat there, writing his examination and happily slurping away.	72	74
hang	STATIVE	Two keys hang in the undertaker's office - one for the organ in the chapel; the other for one of the vehicles in the garage.	9	12

look	STATIVE	"You look like a 60-year-old."""	4	7
married	DYNAMIC	Well, my wife and I made a pact when we got married that whenever she got mad she would go into the kitchen and cool off and I would go outside for a walk to settle down.	44	50

working	DYNAMIC	On the day of the accident, I was working alone on the roof of a new six-storey building.	34	40
attached	STATIVE	Rather than carry the bricks down by hand, I decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley, which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor.	108	115
loaded	DYNAMIC	Securing the rope at ground level, I went up to the roof, I swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it.	85	90
weigh	STATIVE	You will note in Block 11 of the accident report form that I weigh 135lbs.	61	65
jerked	STATIVE	Due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly, I lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope.	28	33
say	STATIVE	Needless to say, I proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building.	12	15
continued	DYNAMIC	Slowed only slightly, I continued my rapid ascent, not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley.	24	32
weighed	STATIVE	Now devoid of the weight of the bricks, that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs.	52	58
refer	DYNAMIC	I refer you again to my weight.	2	6
imagine	STATIVE	As you might imagine, I began a rapid descent, down the side of the building.	13	20
watching	DYNAMIC	I am sorry to report, however, as I lay there on the pile of bricks, in pain, unable to move, I again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and I had to lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me.	187	194
explains	STATIVE	This explains the two broken legs.	5	12
thinking	DYNAMIC	I was thinking about how people seem to read the Bible a whole lot more as they get older, then it dawned on me...they were cramming for their finals...	6	13
thought	DYNAMIC	I thought about how mothers feed their babies with little tiny spoons and forks, so I wonder what Chinese mothers use.	2	8

is	DYNAMIC	Since everthing is to be found in Shakespeare, it is not surprising that on at least two occasions the Board has contributed his own Red Pants nuggets.	16	17
assured	DYNAMIC	There is that oft-quoted example, near the opening of Trial by Jury , where Defendant asks, “Is this the Court of the Exchequer?” and having been assured that it was, Defendant (aside) commands himself to “Be firm, be firm, my pecker.” The British, of course, do not giggle at this bit of Gilbertian dialogue, since to them pecker means `courage,' as in the phrase “to keep your pecker up.” Two of the more common examples of British-American divergence of usage are screw and knock up .	146	152
making	DYNAMIC	In Vanity Fair (Chapter 39), the niggardly Sir Pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat your American sophomore might fancy him to be when he “screwed his tenants by letter.” He was simply making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees.	187	192
had	DYNAMIC	In Chapter VI of Vanity Fair , Thackeray reports on Joe Sedley's drunken avowal to wed Becky Sharp the next morning, even if he had to “knock up the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth,” in order to have him in readiness to perform the ceremony.	128	130

take	STATIVE	It does not take a too-wicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a lewd nature.	12	15
reads	DYNAMIC	Who can, for instance, blame a youth with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing when he reads in Pater's Marius The Epicurean (Chapter V) a reference to Apuleius' The Golden Ass noting that “all through the book, there is an unmistakably real feeling for asses ...”?	95	99
was	DYNAMIC	A Gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine.	16	18
disclosed	STATIVE	2—Cities of the Plain (translated by C. K. Scott Moncrieff—Modern Library, N.Y., 1934, Page 90) to cause the Duchess to say, “Apart from your balls, can't I be of any use to you?” There is a famous letter penned by Rupert Brooke to his friend, Edward Marsh, from somewhere near Fiji (p. 463 of A Treasury of the World's Great Letters , Simon and Schuster, N.Y., 1940) in which he relates how he sends his native boy up a palm tree, where he “cuts off a couple of vast nuts ...” (macho victim not disclosed).	496	506
offers	DYNAMIC	In the first chapter of Uncle Tom's Cabin , Miss Stowe offers a dialogue between Haley and Mr. Shelby, part of which goes, “ `Well,' said Haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season, `what do you say?'	55	60

acknowledged	STATIVE	even though it is generally acknowledged that Paris is número uno in this area of human activity.	28	39
describes	DYNAMIC	An arresting one occurs in A Passage to India (Chapter XXI) in which Forster describes a small building as “a flimsy and frivolous erection,” while in The Mayor of Casterbridge (Chapter XVI) the Mayor himself “beheld the unattractive exterior of Farfrae's erection.” A phrase can paint an astonishing picture for the reader.	77	85
describes	DYNAMIC	Consider Dickens' sharp image in Bleak House (Chapter LIV) when he describes how “Sir Leicester leans back in his chair, and breathlessly ejaculates.... ” Or, in Nicholas Nickleby (Chapter XLVII), where that admirable novelist graphically portrays how old Arthur Gride “again raised his hands, again chuckled, and again ejaculated.” And in his short tale, Lionizing , Edgar Allan Poe is quite candid in describing the reaction of one of his characters: “ ` Admirable! '	67	75
thrown	STATIVE	he ejaculated, thrown quite off his guard by the beauty of the manoeuvre.”	15	20
bound	STATIVE	His head was bound with pansies over-blown,	13	17
refers	DYNAMIC	in his dialogue with Desdemona and Emilia on the praise of women, Iago refers to the kind that	71	76
is	DYNAMIC	And what in the world is one to make of William Butler Yeats's startling revelation in his poem Lapis Lazuli (from Last Poems ) that	22	23
feels	DYNAMIC	In The Bride of Lammermoor (Chapter VI) Bucklaw vows, “I will chop them off with my whinger,” and one feels quite let down when he learns that a whinger is but a whinyard, which is merely a short sword.	102	106
startled	STATIVE	“Turning a corner of the Mazza Gallerie into a women's tennis store, I was startled to see ... hordes of giggling high school girls ... ” [From an article by Dorothy Gilliam in the Washington Post , .	75	82
called	STATIVE	If you are a fan of old-fashioned jazz—what is now known as “traditional” or “trad” jazz—you are familiar with one of the standard “jump tunes” of the genre—a tune most commonly called Muskrat Ramble .	178	183
labeled	STATIVE	My memory is rickety, but I am sure my first recording was labeled MUSKRAT RAMBLE, and I think, though I am less sure, that it was played by the late “Muggsy” Spanier, who was, to my mind, one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters.	59	65
said	STATIVE	The label said, MUSKAT RAMBLE.	10	14
called	STATIVE	(This, remember, was in my youth, and it was a time when typographical errors were called typographical errors, not typos—at least by kids in junior high.)	83	88
had	DYNAMIC	Not only had they left out the “R”; they'd changed the “K” to “C”.	9	11
made	STATIVE	Now, it made no sense at all.	8	11
called	STATIVE	On the other hand, I reasoned, if there were, in fact, some sort of cat called a muscat, perhaps it wasn't so outrageous.	72	77
looked	DYNAMIC	I looked up muscat in my Webster's and found that it is a `variety of grape.'	2	7
committed	DYNAMIC	Now might be as good a time as any to reveal a theft I committed at an Air Force Base near Seymour, Indiana.	55	63
called	DYNAMIC	Among Bessie's numbers were Dying Gambler's Blues, Sing Sing Prison Blues , and one I had never heard called Black Mountain Blues , which has the imcomparable lines,	102	107
shoot	STATIVE	Goin' cut him if he stan' still, goin' shoot him if he run.	39	43
kept	STATIVE	I kept them in good shape until my last 78-rpm turntable died.	2	5
credited	STATIVE	End of digression and back to MUSKRAT-KAT-CAT: Muskrat Ramble is credited to Edward “Kid” Ory and Ray Gilbert.	65	72
played	STATIVE	“Kid” Ory played great jazz trombone.	10	15
appear	DYNAMIC	They do not appear to do much rambling.	12	17
assume	STATIVE	It is the same reason most of us, I assume, have heard, “He's in the hospital with prostrate trouble.” Prostrate is a more common word that prostate , so prostrate is what we get.	36	42
pushing	STATIVE	I got a strange sort of corroboration from my good friend Rosy McHargue, who is now pushing eighty-seven years and has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbands—Benny Goodman, Red Nichols, Ted Weems, and a slew of others.	84	90
find	STATIVE	I find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually.	2	5
refer	STATIVE	I refer to the first sentence of your article about the Longman Dictionary [XV,1].	2	6
describes	DYNAMIC	But she betrays her own elitist insensitivity when she describes a flight attendant as “the person who passes peanuts on an airplane.” I hope Ms./Miss/Mrs.	55	63
indicating	STATIVE	In addition, there was a rich collection of words relating to water, not necessarily indicating its presence.	85	94
indicate	STATIVE	“Hoping to find a lake” is included, though of course it doesn't indicate the presence of water.	65	72
appear	DYNAMIC	Gum-trees or rocks (in areas of sand) appear as signs of possible water.	38	43
refers	DYNAMIC	Gregory uses stream in the way normal in England; Giles consistently refers to gens in the hills of central Australia, though glen is not current (outside place-names) in contemporary Australian English.	69	74
describes	DYNAMIC	Carnegie also describes namma-holes and soaks as sources of water.	14	22
sunk	STATIVE	Soaks are shallow wells sunk near the base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir.	24	27
did	STATIVE	Perhaps these words did not really fit.	20	22
lists	DYNAMIC	Fowler lists five instances where a careless writer can go wrong.	7	11
appears	STATIVE	Her suitor, Neigh, who had proposed marriage in a previous chapter, appears somewhat apprehensive at Ethelberta's suggestion.	68	74
poses	DYNAMIC	Mark Twain poses us a little mystery in Pudd'nhead Wilson: which knife does the killing?	11	15
detected	DYNAMIC	I was asleep, but Luigi was awake, and he thought he detected a vague form nearing the bed.	53	60
aimed	DYNAMIC	Suddenly that native rose at the bedside, and bent over me with his right hand lifted and a dirk in it aimed at my throat; but Luigi grabbed his wrist, pulled him downward, and drove his own knife into the man's neck.	103	107
speak	STATIVE	Journalist Charles Rappaport once quipped, “I speak ten languages—all of them Yiddish.”	46	50
holds	DYNAMIC	Quickly she holds up a cross.	12	16
speak	STATIVE	Most of us already speak a fair amount of Yiddish (Yinglish) without fully realizing it.	19	23
lists	STATIVE	Webster's Third New International Dictionary lists about 500 Yiddish words that have become part of our everyday conversations, including:	45	49
offers	DYNAMIC	In his delightful study, The Joys of Yiddish (McGraw-Hill 1968), Leo Rosten offers two classic definitions.	76	81
defined	DYNAMIC	A chutzpanik may be defined as the man who shouts `Help!	20	26
express	DYNAMIC	oy not so much a word as an entire vocabulary, as Rosten observes: “can express any emotion, from trivial delight to the blackest woe.”	72	78
assigned	STATIVE	Yiddish is especially versatile in describing those poor souls who inhabit the world of the ineffectual, and each is assigned a distinct place in the gallery of pathetic types: schmo, schmendrik, schnook, schmegegge, schlep, schlub, schmuck, putz, klutz, kvetch , and nudnik .	117	124
has	DYNAMIC	(And the nebbish is the one who has to clean it up.)	32	34
reminds	STATIVE	Which reminds us of the zaftig `buxom, well-rounded' blonde who wore an enormous diamond to a charity ball.	6	12
happens	STATIVE	“It happens to be the third most famous diamond in the whole world,” she boasted.	4	10
called	STATIVE	“The first is the Hope diamond, then comes the Kohinoor, and then comes this one, which is called the Lipschitz.”	91	96
offers	STATIVE	The work in question offers nothing regarding language, so its review here is ancillary to the main function of VERBATIM.	21	26
praised	STATIVE	Because writing an unfavorable review of a (bad) feminist book would be tantamount to treachery, such books are often unjustifiably praised, as was the case with this work by Rosalind Miles, which was well received on its publication in June.	132	139
bear	DYNAMIC	One might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship, but the text does not bear out the promise.	109	112
suggests	DYNAMIC	Miles suggests that such domination is a recent phenomenon—only a couple of thousand years old—for she points to the clear superiority of women in (primitive) religions and matriarchies, right on through to the Egyptian dynastic rulers.	6	13
suggests	DYNAMIC	At one point, she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting (in order to keep track of menstruation) and, probably by the same token, astronomy.	64	71
built	DYNAMIC	In the good old days, we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves.	60	64
built	DYNAMIC	Here comes Miles, authoritatively quoting Diodorus, the Greek historian, who recorded (60-30BC) that “innocent women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves whose forced labour built the pyramids:	178	182
accept	DYNAMIC	It is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery to promulgate it.	61	66
is	DYNAMIC	From the poet Sappho, who in the sixth century BC was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively and explore the range of female experience, to the Chinese polymath Pan Chao (Ban Zhao), who flourished around AD 100 as historian, poet, astronomer, mathematician and educationalist, the range is startling.	297	298
was	DYNAMIC	Clearly, this rosily checkered past was soon to be replaced, chiefly, it seems, as Judeo-Christian-Islamic-Confucian-Buddhist cultures flourished.	36	38
continues	DYNAMIC	Miles continues:	6	15
following	STATIVE	Citing a Judaic law-book of the 16th century which identified a woman for the days preceding, during, and following her period as niddah `impure,' Miles has the lack of taste to write the following:.	106	114
account	STATIVE	Although this might help explain the Judeo-Christian-Muslim tendencies to subjugate women, treating them essentially as chattel, it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures, notably that of Japan.	141	147
held	STATIVE	Campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and that there was no real distinction between gods and goddesses, who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful.	9	12
gone	STATIVE	Most of the relies from the past are gone forever, destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers, reduced to rubble by erosion, by conquerors, by prehistoric (and modern) urban developers, by fire and flood, and just by time.	37	40
become	STATIVE	The interest in man's forebears did not become fashionable upon the publication, a few years ago, of Roots : on a far larger scale, we have been trying to discover all we can about the origins not of men but of man.	40	45
documented	STATIVE	Even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse: Classical Latin and Greek, Hebrew, and a few other languages are better documented than others; but for most all we have to go on are a handful of tablets here, a few inscriptions there, barely enough in many cases to allow us to identify the language, let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning.	168	177
missed	DYNAMIC	The total was approximately 2800, but that is probably only a vague estimate: he undoubtedly missed some; some have sprung up since his time (modern Hebrew, for instance); and some have vanished.	93	98
did	STATIVE	Some, like French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, had more in common with one another than they did with, say, German, English, Swedish, Danish, and Dutch, which, in turn, bore only a remote resemblance to Russian and Polish, on the one hand, and the two extant varieties of, say, Gaelic, on the other.	99	101
runs	DYNAMIC	One rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes, for after years of laboriously categorizing these languages, the number of different main branches (called families and subfamilies) came to about ten.	12	15
classified	STATIVE	Although certain other languages were geographically nearby, it was impossible to establish any resemblances between them, hence Basque, for example, is not classified as being in the same family with other European languages, nor are Hungarian and Finnish, both of which belong to their own group.	157	166
linked	DYNAMIC	At the conclusion of this vast exercise, done without the aid of computers, there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken, in earlier times, from Britain as far east as Chinese Turkestan and from India as far north as Lappland.	131	136
drawn	DYNAMIC	The languages discussed here are what are usually called the Indo-European family; similar family trees could be drawn for the Semitic languages, Sino-Tibetan, Japanese, Bantu, Malayo-Polynesian, and so on.	113	117
considered	STATIVE	Each is a distinct phylum; although there may be word-borrowing among them, lexicon is considered less important in the classification of languages than structure and grammar.	87	96
written	DYNAMIC	It is important, too, to note that writing systems are irrelevant: for instance, Polish is written (today) using the Roman alphabet, but Russian, a related Slavic language, uses the Cyrillic; Yiddish, a Germanic language, is written in Hebrew characters; Latin, Greek, and Sanskrit, which resemble one another rather closely in some respects, all use different alphabets; and early examples, utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages, were written in cuneiform, quite suitable for writing on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus, and hieroglyphics.	91	97
correlated	DYNAMIC	But only rarely did they collaborate and, with few exceptions, their work was not correlated in a systematic way.	82	91
take	STATIVE	In many other places, the ancient sites lay buried—and still do—beneath modern cities: modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below.	131	134
yield	DYNAMIC	But there, as everywhere else, nothing can interfere with progress and, regardless of the finds and their importance, the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer.	152	156
provide	DYNAMIC	Notwithstanding, even the brief glimpses afforded by such investigations can provide some insight into civilizations that existed hundreds or, in some cases, thousands of years earlier.	77	83
descended	STATIVE	That is not entirely true, for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was, literally, a single language from which all Indo-European languages descended.	170	179
referred	DYNAMIC	Nonetheless, it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of proto-dialects which can be referred to as Proto-Indo-European.	101	108
was	DYNAMIC	It seems only natural that once an original language, or Ursprache , was posited, the next step was to speculate on its source, or Urheimat .	69	71
is	DYNAMIC	That is what Renfrew has tried to do.	5	6
modified	DYNAMIC	Essentially, he proposes that the parent of all Indo-European languages was itself born in central Anatolia, whence it spread eastward, westward, and northward, being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact, till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable, modern manifestations which we categorize into Germanic, Hellenic, Italic, Indo-Iranian, Anatolian, Armenian, Celtic, Tocharian, Albanian, and BaltoSlavic.	167	174
separated	DYNAMIC	Using the evidence available, Renfrew contends that the original Indo-European language, closely related to Hittite, separated after 6500 BC, with the IE languages of western Europe developing from western Anatolia and those of Iran, India, and Pakistan from the eastern division.	117	125
dealing	DYNAMIC	Unfortunately, the presentation of his linguistic argument, where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology, where he is on more familiar territory, is disorganized and repetitious.	144	150
provides	STATIVE	Nevertheless, good books on archaeology assimilable by laymen are not easy to find, and if the reader can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned about the precise birthplace of Indo-European, Archaelogy & Language provides an interesting march through the millennia of prehistory in seven-league boots.	229	236
called	DYNAMIC	I called up the synonyms for the adj and the following appeared:	2	7
missing	DYNAMIC	However, when I highlighted antecedent , what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent missing, and preceding had reappeared.	119	126
works	DYNAMIC	It works with a hard disk or with a set of floppies and can be used with 29 popular word-processing programs.	3	7
listed	STATIVE	(That was the number listed when I received my copy; it might have increased.)	21	26
called	DYNAMIC	It has a useful “Help” feature that can be called upon at any stage.	43	48
documented	DYNAMIC	The article is a classic, probably the first on the subject to appear in a scholarly journal, though there are other informal references to family language, some of which are documented by Dickson in his Bibliography.	175	184
alternating	DYNAMIC	The soldier in charge would command, after each firing, that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded, thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire.	153	163
bear	STATIVE	Mr. Davidson's observations on the Scottishness of Chambers 20th Century Dictionary [XV,1] bear out my own formed over sixteen years of using one.	91	94
employed	DYNAMIC	The monkey on board ship was a lad employed to fetch supplies—powder and so forth—to the guns.	35	42
kept	STATIVE	The word might also have been used for a receptacle near the guns where powder and balls were kept.	94	98
said	STATIVE	They can still be found today in so-called “gift shops.” Usually, they come in sets of three, one with its hands over its eyes, one over its ears, and one over its mouth: they were said to represent “See no evil, Hear no evil, Speak no evil.” There were various whimsical variants.	181	184
representing	STATIVE	The main problems are representing consonant clusters and word-final consonants.	22	33
come	STATIVE	My absolute favorite of these semantic mistakes, however, does not come from the problem of sound.	67	70
expresses	STATIVE	Japanese has a verb inflection which expresses causation or permission—in English, “to make someone or to let someone do something.” One day during a university English class, a very discomfited student, after frantic and obtrusive dictionary work, handed a colleague of mine a scrap of paper.	37	45
written	STATIVE	On it was written this sentence: “Please make me go to the bathroom.”	10	16
strikes	DYNAMIC	Times , may agree with me in the contention that when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off: I cannot put my finger on why, but “On Language” always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute.	174	180
keep	STATIVE	In part, that is attributable to the designation of his correspondents, who keep him informed on language that is not within earshot, as the “Lexicographic Irregulars,” an amusing reference the first time or two it was used but now beginning to cloy.	76	79
prove	STATIVE	More often than it might prove of interest to me, personally, Safire deals with insiders' language in Washington (where he is based) or with trivialities uttered by some politico.	25	29
accept	DYNAMIC	We are descriptive of the usages we accept and prescriptive—perhaps proscriptive would be more descriptive—of those we do not like.	36	41
expresses	DYNAMIC	At least Safire expresses an opinion; whether the reader agrees with him is another matter, as are the questions of his accuracy, which arise fairly often, and that of the suitability of his style, which, as far as I know, has not been broached before.	16	24
find	STATIVE	It ill behooves me, excoriated recently as enamored of the “cheap larf,” to criticize Safire's arch puns, which permeate—“enliven” is probably the word his editor would use—his articles, but I find some kinds of humor unsuitable for reading, however they might evoke a chuckle when uttered viva voce .	193	196
makes	STATIVE	Writing containing such labored figures makes for hard reading.	40	44
find	STATIVE	I am interested in what Safire has to say about language but find myself stymied: I get the feeling that he has deliberately created a minefield of interruptions in thought through which I must pick my way to the end.	61	64
Look	DYNAMIC	You Could Look It Up is the umpteenth collection of Safire's columns and, like the previous collections, contains a selection of letters from readers.	10	13
missed	STATIVE	It is those that are so sorely missed in his column.	31	36
documents	DYNAMIC	For one thing, he documents many neologisms, an activity that endears him to many working lexicographers.	18	26
say	STATIVE	...Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity does not say that E = MC² and in leap year MC³.	52	54
does	STATIVE	Indeed it does not.	10	13
say	STATIVE	But it does say E = mc² ; the version with the capital M and C is, essentially, meaningless to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used in physics.	12	14
called	STATIVE	True, one can find different from , etc., in an entry so headed, but for absolute constructions one is referred to an entry called “Covered with onions, relish, and ketchup, I ate a hotdog at the ball-park.” If the user wants to find out about misplaced adjectives and adverbs , reference is made to the entry “Electric shaver for women with delicate floral design on the handle.” A search for only would be futile.	124	129
put	STATIVE	Perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need some lightening up, but I am hard put to agree that they are quite as frivolous and light-headed as this book would have us believe.	82	84
born	STATIVE	A sense of humor about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it, but security is the one characteristic often lacking among those who would use Current American Usage .	36	39
provide	DYNAMIC	All of which is to say that the book is an interesting work on the language and contains accurate, though longwinded information about what it covers, “interesting and useful facts about American English.” Its only real faults are its title, which belies the content, the cutesy headings, and the lack of a truly detailed index: self-indexing does not provide coverage of sufficient detail.	352	358
expresses	STATIVE	Penny Perrick regrets (January 11) that “There is no word in English to describe that particular, special sort of pride that one feels in the achievements of one's children.” But the verb kvell , which exactly expresses that emotion, is already (like other Yiddish loanwords, such as chutzpah, meshugga and nosh ) to be found in the Supplement to the Oxford-English Dictionary .	210	218
referring	DYNAMIC	The rationale behind referring to them as “lost” arises from the author's observation of an unfortunate state of affairs: because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity with the basic, structural elements of our culture—Greek and Roman mythology, the Bible, literature, and ordinary historical fact—people today are unable to discern the origins of terms like aphrodisiac, Achilles [sic] heel or tendon, meet one's Waterloo, sow dragon's teeth , and hand-writing on the wall , to name a few.	21	29
covered	STATIVE	Between these is an occasional flash of useful wisdom, much of it pretty well covered by other books of this type (which seem to be proliferating).	78	84
borrowed	DYNAMIC	As for stalemate , which is related to checkmate , would it not have been important to indicate that the - mate part has nothing to do with English, having been borrowed from checkmate which is a loanword from Persian (and has nothing to do with check , either).	161	168
got	STATIVE	When you straddle a horse, you've got one leg on either side of the animal.	34	36
straddles	DYNAMIC	When a politican straddles an issue, he's in much the same position.	17	25
marked	STATIVE	Not all entries contain misleading, dull, or incorrect information, but those that do not are marked by a lack of originality.	94	99
prepared	DYNAMIC	Most prominent among its earliest practitioners in England was Joseph Wright, who prepared the six-volume English Dialect Dictionary , which was published between 1898 and 1905; the best-known contemporary British specialist is Harold Orton.	82	89
investigated	STATIVE	In America, work proceeded space during the 1930s, largely under the direction of Raven McDavid, Hans Kurath, and, later, Harold Allen; more recently, Lee Pedersen and others have investigated American English dialects.	180	191
extracted	STATIVE	The present book is extracted from the two major works that resulted from the Survey, The Linguistic Atlas of England (1978) and A Word Geography of England (1974), both under the direction of Harold Orton, aided by Sanderson and Widdowson in the latter effort.	20	28
selected	DYNAMIC	The 100 maps selected for representation from the Survey yield information on several hundred words, some of which are clear variants, others quite different lexical entities.	13	20
shows	STATIVE	Map 33 shows the distribution of child (most of southern England) and of bairn (north of a slightly wavy line between Boston, on the Wash to the east, and Lancaster, on the west coast).	7	11
set	STATIVE	The maps are clear, each occupying a full page, and the word information is well set forth on them.	81	83
drawn	STATIVE	These are drawn to run midway between/ localities which were shown by the Survey of English Dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of the map.	10	14
emphasized	DYNAMIC	The importance of dialect is emphasized regularly in the press, where we read about people being killed, as in parts of India, because they use the wrong shibboleths.	29	38
styled	STATIVE	It is not at once apparent why the book is styled an “almanac,” but that is unimportant: there is no other book I know of that contains as much diverse information about American writers as this one.	43	48
make	STATIVE	Its readability and organization make it suitable for browsing—even for reading straight through—so in that respect, at least, it does not resemble books in the “Oxford Companion” series.	33	36
related	DYNAMIC	A handful might have led colorful existences, some are objects of interest because they died early, committed suicide, were related to (other) famous people, and so forth; but such information seldom reveals as much about their output as do the creations themselves, and in certain cases one is probably better off not knowing quite so much.	124	130
appears	STATIVE	This book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as an adjunct to most libraries, public and private, large and small, general and specialized.	10	16
like	DYNAMIC	I would like to make a couple of comments on articles in the Autumn 1988 issue [XV,2].	8	11
dates	STATIVE	Incidentally, I seem to recall reading somewhere that skins as slang for `dollars' dates from frontier days when trappers used animal skins as currency, and is therefore much older than early 20th-century Harlem.	83	87
keep	STATIVE	-- Donna Because teaching a man to fish will keep him fed for his entire life.	45	48
face	STATIVE	-- Cornell Each year, we help thousands of people who face tremendous obstacles.	54	57
face	STATIVE	A robust economy helps by providing job opportunities, but to be honest, most of the people who aren't working today are quite simply the ones who face the greatest obstacles.	147	150
provide	DYNAMIC	The kinds of services we provide help people deal with obstacles like health care, transportation and child care -problems that are big enough on their own without being compounded by factors like physical and mental disabilities, illiteracy and lack of job skills.	25	31
working	STATIVE	If I wasn't working here...I would be sad... Goodwill helps people get off of public assistance.	12	18
rise	DYNAMIC	Sherry learned through our Future Works class that she could rise out of the mire of the welfare system and support her family.	61	64
combined	DYNAMIC	He trained in desktop publishing and combined his enthusiastic work ethic with new-found skills in a burgeoning industry.	37	44
provides	DYNAMIC	Goodwill provides jobs at Goodwill.	9	16
call	STATIVE	His job objectives call for him to do it in 30.	19	22
called	DYNAMIC	"In their December, 1995 review of the nation's best charities, U.S. News & World Report called Goodwill one of the five ""Standout Good Guys."""	88	93
affect	DYNAMIC	While I appreciate U.S. News & World Report's endorsement, the true value of your support is measured by the way Goodwill takes on problems that affect all of us.	145	150
act	STATIVE	Parents act as role models of self-sufficiency instead of dependency.	8	10
confirms	DYNAMIC	once his tears have subsided, he confirms what his classmates have already figured out: he just received a job offer -- his first in five years.	33	40
takes	STATIVE	It takes a long time for him to gain the self-confidence to work elsewhere in the community.	3	7
leaves	DYNAMIC	He proudly leaves Goodwill to support himself.	11	16
like	DYNAMIC	Just like the respect we've earned from U.S. News & World Report.	5	8
do	STATIVE	Neither do the rest of us who feel the positive results of their success.	8	9
has	DYNAMIC	Everyone has.	9	12
keep	STATIVE	There are a lot of barriers that keep people from working: physical and mental disabilities, history of welfare dependency and lack of education or self-esteem.	33	36
continue	DYNAMIC	So our work must continue.	17	25
benefits	DYNAMIC	Everyone benefits from the work we do together.	9	16
felt	STATIVE	Michael Sims felt that way at age 39 -- the day he earned a job.	13	16
born	DYNAMIC	Michael was born with cerebral palsy.	12	15
lasted	STATIVE	His most recent job lasted only a year before cut-backs eliminated his position.	20	25
called	DYNAMIC	Finally, Michael called Goodwill.	17	22
provides	DYNAMIC	As the Clubhouse Monitor at Bent Tree Apartments, he now provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night.	57	64
set	STATIVE	Now his goals are set on moving up in the company.	18	20
share	STATIVE	Like Michael, they share two common characteristics.	19	23
face	STATIVE	They face some barrier to employment and they want to work.	5	8
comes	STATIVE	With support from people like you, they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the self-sufficiency that comes with it.	115	119
counted	STATIVE	The savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents, however.	16	22
focused	STATIVE	The families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms of a house to live in, money to purchase food -- without food stamps -- and the beginning of a family focused on success, not hopelessness.	176	182
provides	DYNAMIC	Their complaint: the system discourages working because unemployment provides benefits that many entry-level jobs don't include.	69	76
are	DYNAMIC	While the debate on welfare reform is gathering like a storm at sea, the people who need jobs are floundering.	94	96
take	STATIVE	March 17, 2000 Name Address City, ST, Zip Dear Name: When Jerry was released from prison, he knew it would take hard work and determination to straighten out his life.	107	110
was	DYNAMIC	Reality hit when he was unable to reconcile with his wife and ended up on the street.	20	22
referred	DYNAMIC	The Trustee referred him to the Blue Triangle where he consulted Goodwill's Career Academy staff for job search assistance.	12	19
faced	STATIVE	Unemployed, homeless and with a prison record, Jerry now faced going back to prison for failure to pay child support.	57	61
took	STATIVE	It took some time and hard work, but with the help of Goodwill, Jerry was able to work out a payment plan with the prosecutor's office, find housing and conduct a more thorough job search.	3	6

matched	DYNAMIC	"I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992.	August 10, 1999 Mr. Caring Philanthropy 01234 Giving Way Contribution, USA 56789 Dear Mr. Philanthropy, The urgency you feel to make changes is just the extent that change will be made. Do not sit this one out. Do not play it safe. Understand the world and change it where it needs to be changed... Make our society better. Make a world worthy of the children that your generation will bear."" -- Carl Sagan You can help make positive changes in the lives of at-risk youth in central Indiana. We often hear about economic poverty, but what some of these young people are growing up with is emotional poverty-they have often given up on hope and the possibility of a successful future. With your help, we can change that. Many Little Sisters are preparing to go back to school this fall full of hope and with a positive outlook. Thanks to our Big Sisters volunteers, these young people are self-confident, believe in themselves and are beginning to realize their full potential. A recent study by Public/Private Ventures (PPV) showed that girls who had a Big Sister for just one year: reduced first-time drug use by 46% lowered school absenteeism by 52% cut violent behavior by 33% enhanced school performance showed improved peer and family relationships Former Little Sister Amy, now 18-years old, is a testament to the Big Sisters program. ""I was matched with my Big Sister in June of 1992. Since then, she and I have grown very close and I have been able to experience lots of new things. We go to movies, dinner, concerts, and other stuff like that, but I have also been able to participate in charity events and fundraiser type things. Not only did I have a lot of fun with my Big Sister, but I learned a lot from her too. I have become more open-minded, more responsible, and, most importantly, I have gained a lot more self-confidence. I am very thankful to the Big Sisters program for allowing me this very special opportunity. In 1998, Big Sisters served 972 young people through its many programs. But the need is still great. Over 170 young people are still waiting for a mentor. You are an important part in making sure these young people are matched with caring adult mentors. Will you make a financial gift to Big Sisters in 1999 that will ensure that more young people receive the guidance they need, that more young people stay in school, stay off drugs and make good choices? Your contribution will be used to recruit and retain quality volunteers. It will also be used to help maintain the infrastructure that fosters and supports the development of effective relationships, including volunteer orientation and training and ongoing supervision and support by a professional staff. This year your gift can go farther! Gifts of $100 or more will be matched thanks to a special 25th Anniversary $100,000 Challenge Grant and will be placed in the Growth For Girls Fund. This fund will support the goal of having 550 mentoring relationships by the end of 1999 and 1,200 by the end of 2004. If you would like to find out more about the Big Sisters program, please call us, (317) 634-6102 and ask for Ellen Robinson. Thank you very much for your time, attention and consideration. Sincerely, Andrew T. Burns Patron Relations Chairperson P.S. When you give to Big Sisters, you can get 50% back! For a minimum contribution of $250, you become eligible for a 50% Indiana state tax credit through the Indiana Department of Commerce Neighborhood Assistance Program (NAP).

That was more evident here than in any other city, said George Starke, who after his career as an offensive tackle with the Washington Redskins from 1973 to 1984 stuck around and decided to make this place more than his home. There was death in D.C. throughout the '80s and into the '90s, and there was death everywhere,"" said Starke, who was reared in New Rochelle, N.Y., and played at Columbia. ""It wasn't like New York's or Boston's organized crime. It was kids shooting kids. It was a 14-year-old from R Street who got his crew of six together and ran their drug block killing another 14-year-old and his crew from a block away. And from the beginning I could see that it was all about jobs. I could see that you needed the private sector involved."" Starke could see that in many instances these were cases of lost dignity. ""I had a young man come up to me three years ago and say, 'Mr. Starke, I'm tired of going to bed at night with a Tech-9 gun under my pillow.""' And Starke was tired of seeing Washington and its young people suffer a black eye. So, after six years of planning, he opened the Excel Institute Automotive Program, a two-year school that gives people a chance at a new life as an auto technician or in another job related to the field. The school, now in its third year, has been so successful that it recently received a $2 million grant from Congress. The program is being copied by other cities and has attracted students from all walks of life, ages 16 to 68. The program is coordinated with the University of the District of Columbia. Students learn automotive intricacies and can earn a a high school equivalency diploma. Thanks to Starke's vision, leadership and fund-raising, they can do it all free. Starke, 54, played in two Super Bowls and won one. He played for George Allen, Jack Pardee and Joe Gibbs. In 1973, he was young enough to be a part of the Redskins' Over the Hill Gang, and in 1981 he was old enough to be one of the team's original Hogs. He was recently named one of the 70 greatest Redskins. He earned a physics degree from Columbia, became a Redskin, studied drama, worked in sports broadcasting, opened a Washington restaurant and built his own home here when he thought he might become a developer, ""just so I could know how the business worked from the ground up,"" he said. In 1988 he bought a Ford dealership. In 1992 he sold it to begin work on the Excel Institute, putting up $300,000 to get things started. ""I saw a lot of kids and young men out there with no dads and no structure who couldn't read and some of them were beginning to realize that there is no growing old as a crack dealer -- you either die or go to jail,"" he said. ""My experience in the automotive industry was there was a dire shortage of auto technicians not only in America but internationally."" So, Starke matched a problem with a problem and found a solution. The institute has a full-time staff of 18. Twelve of those are teachers. Seventy students are participating in summer classes. Forty new students are expected for fall classes and there is a waiting list of at least that many, Starke said. Angela Nafis, 47, of Ecuador, has been in the school for a year. She learned to speak English, got a driver's license and earned her GED. Charles Easterling, 24, said he had been enrolled for a month but lived ""wherever."" ""I'm homeless now trying to find a place to lay my head,"" he said. Starke said the school was helping Easterling find housing. Easterling said he would do whatever it took to become stable. John Orellana, 22, just got a technician's job at a Jiffy Lube last week. Not bad for a guy who was kicked out of high school in 1997 for threatening a teacher. ""I did a lot of walking, got an interview and got a job and an opportunity of a lifetime,"" Orellana said. ""It shows if you have the will and the dedication here you can learn a lot and be something. It taught me maturity. This school is like a big family."" Edward Jewell, 56, retired from his job as a copyright assistant at the Library of Congress in 1993. ""I've been flapping my wings since until I found this school,"" he said. ""I needed a new skill. This has been invaluable, enriching. I get up and come down here at 6 a.m. every day full of joy and energized. I'm grateful to George Starke to have had the vision to set something like this up, not just for me but for all the students. George is doing what he's supposed to be doing because God is blessing him and he's sure blessing me. And when I become a technician, I will help the poor and needy by giving them affordable rates."" Starke said the school would move to a building near the city's bus depot in the fall. The city has talked with Starke about using his students for some vehicle repairs. He is proud of the red Cobra 427 that sits in the school's workshop. It was rebuilt from shell to finish by his first class and was included in the district's millennium celebrations. His current class is rebuilding a black one. This one will be auctioned for the school. ""I just wanted to be a part,"" said Starke, who is certain he is the lone Redskin, past or present, who lives in the city. He has lived here for 20 years. ""A lot of kids are afraid of 'the process' and I wanted to take 'the process' out. For this school, once they are in, all they have to do is come every day, come on time every day and work hard. A little more than 50 percent of our kids make it through. I want it to be more, but my job is not to see that everybody makes it; my job is to see that everybody has the opportunity to make it."""	2	4

held	STATIVE	Consensus once held that today's baseball is a North American development from the older game rounders, popular in Great Britain and Ireland.	15	18
suggests	DYNAMIC	Baseball Before We Knew It: A Search for the Roots of the Game (2005), by David Block, suggests that the game originated in England; recently uncovered historical evidence supports this position.	87	94
argues	DYNAMIC	"Block argues that rounders and early baseball were actually regional variants of each other, and that the game's most direct antecedents are the English games of stoolball and ""tut-ball""."	6	11
suggests	DYNAMIC	It has long been believed that cricket also descended from such games, though evidence uncovered in early 2009 suggests that cricket may have been imported to England from Flanders.	111	118
shows	STATIVE	"It contains a rhymed description of ""base-ball"" and a woodcut that shows a field set-up somewhat similar to the modern game—though in a triangular rather than diamond configuration, and with posts instead of ground-level bases."	67	71
featured	STATIVE	"David Block discovered that the first recorded game of ""Bass-Ball"" took place in 1749 in Surrey, and featured the Prince of Wales as a player."	101	108

referred	DYNAMIC	"These games were often referred to locally as ""town ball"", though other names such as ""round-ball"" and ""base-ball"" were also used."	23	30
recognized	STATIVE	"While there are reports that the New York Knickerbockers played games in 1845, the contest now recognized as the first officially recorded baseball game in U.S. history took place on June 19, 1846, in Hoboken, New Jersey: the ""New York Nine"" defeated the Knickerbockers, 23–1, in four innings."	95	104
were	DYNAMIC	"By 1856, local journals were referring to baseball as the ""national pastime"" or ""national game""."	24	27

representing	DYNAMIC	The pact formalized relations both between the two major leagues and between them and the National Association of Professional Base Ball Leagues, representing most of the country's minor professional leagues.	146	157
held	DYNAMIC	The next year, the series was not held, as the National League champion New York Giants, under manager John McGraw, refused to recognize the major league status of the American League and its champion.	34	38
were	DYNAMIC	During the major leagues' early decades, players on various teams occasionally attempted strikes, which routinely failed when their jobs were sufficiently threatened.	137	140
tended	STATIVE	In general, the strict rules of baseball contracts and the reserve clause, which bound players to their teams even when their contracts had ended, tended to keep the players in check.	147	152
demanded	STATIVE	"The ""inside game"", which demanded that players ""scratch for runs"", was played much more aggressively than it is today: the brilliant and often violent Ty Cobb epitomized this style."	25	32
banning	STATIVE	Strict new regulations governing the ball's size, shape and composition along with a new rule officially banning the spitball, along with other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances after the death of Ray Chapman who was hit by a pitch in August 1920, coupled with superior materials available after World War I, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit.	105	111
had	DYNAMIC	The construction of additional seating to accommodate the rising popularity of the game often had the effect of bringing the outfield fences closer in, making home runs more common.	94	96
invested	DYNAMIC	"In the late 1920s and early 1930s, St. Louis Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern ""farm system""."	85	92
held	DYNAMIC	The inaugural College World Series was held in 1947, and the Babe Ruth League youth program was founded.	39	42

gain	DYNAMIC	Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point.	61	64
nailed	STATIVE	The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators on the balcony began to interfere with shots.	28	33
called	DYNAMIC	"Naismith called the new game ""Basket Ball""."	9	14
spread	DYNAMIC	Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the USA and Canada.	99	104
established	STATIVE	By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools.	21	31
discouraged	DYNAMIC	While the YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from the YMCA's primary mission.	99	109
including	DYNAMIC	In 1901, colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Dartmouth College, the University of Minnesota, the U.S.	19	27

count	DYNAMIC	A player and the dealer can count his or her own ace as 1 point or 11 points.	28	32
shown	STATIVE	All other cards are counted as the numeric value shown on the card.	49	53
called	STATIVE	"If a player holds an ace valued as 11, the hand is called ""soft"", meaning that the player cannot go bust by taking an additional card; 11 plus the value of any other card will always be less than or equal to 21."	51	56
called	STATIVE	"If the player and dealer have the same point total, this is called a ""push"", and the player typically does not win or lose money on that hand."	60	65

influenced	DYNAMIC	Recruitment is often influenced by a recruitee's environment.	21	30
offers	STATIVE	Gang membership offers youth a sense of belonging and protection.	16	21
offers	STATIVE	It also offers immediate gratification to economically disadvantaged youth who desire the trappings of gang life: gold jewelry, cash, expensive sports clothing.	8	13
survived	STATIVE	The ranks do not signify leadership or dominance over the set, they merely signify respect for those who have been in the set longer and have survived the longest.	142	149
referred	DYNAMIC	"Bloods with higher rank are often referred to as ""Big Homies"" by Bloods with lower rank."	34	41
refer	DYNAMIC	"They also refer to each other as ""relatives""."	10	14

attributed	STATIVE	"Buddhism is a nontheistic religion that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and practices largely based on teachings attributed to Siddhartha Gautama, who is commonly known as the Buddha, meaning ""the awakened one""."	126	135
develops	DYNAMIC	In awakening to the true nature of the self and all phenomena one develops dispassion for the objects of clinging, and is liberated from suffering (dukkha) and the cycle of incessant rebirths (saṃsāra).	66	73
consider	STATIVE	Buddhists do not consider Siddhartha Gautama to have been the only Buddha.	17	24
named	STATIVE	A common Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist belief is that the next Buddha will be one named Maitreya (Pali: Metteyya).	84	88
written	STATIVE	Buddhist scriptures are mainly written in Pāli, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Chinese.	31	37
referred	STATIVE	Unlike many religions, Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions.	79	86
referred	DYNAMIC	However, some scholars have referred to the Vinaya Pitaka and the first four Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka as the common core of all Buddhist traditions.	28	35
accepted	STATIVE	Other scholars say there is no universally accepted common core.	43	50
championed	DYNAMIC	Later in Sri Lanka, the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture.	39	48

nailed	DYNAMIC	A thinner sheet of plywood is nailed on as the sixth side, and acts as the striking surface or head.	30	35
left	STATIVE	The top edges are often left unattached and can be slapped against the box.	24	27
sits	DYNAMIC	The player sits astride the box, tilting it at an angle while striking the head between his knees.	11	14
spread	DYNAMIC	After slavery the cajón was spread to a much larger audience including Criollos.	28	33
adapted	DYNAMIC	These instruments were adapted by Peruvian slaves from the Spanish shipping crates at their disposal.	23	29
states	STATIVE	Another theory states that slaves simply used boxes as musical instruments to subvert Spanish colonial bans on music in predominantly African areas; In this way, cajones could easily be disguised as seats or stools, thus avoiding identification as musical instruments.	15	20
is	DYNAMIC	In all likelihood it is a combination of these factors - African origins and Spanish suppression of slave music - that led to the cajón's creation.	21	22
enables	DYNAMIC	This enables the player to beat it just like a pedal-bass-drum, but it also restricts the player's standard position.	5	11
referring	STATIVE	Many states have what are termed capitalist mixed economies, referring to a mix between planned and market-driven elements.	61	69
corrupted	STATIVE	Crony capitalism is an economic system corrupted by a close relationship between businesses and government officials.	39	47
associate	DYNAMIC	Critics of capitalism variously associate it with economic instability, an inability to provide for the well-being of all people, and an unsustainable danger to the natural environment.	32	40
traced	DYNAMIC	However, capitalism in its modern form is usually traced to the emergence of agrarian capitalism and mercantilism of the Early Modern era.	50	55
employed	DYNAMIC	Instead of a serf-based system of labor, workers were increasingly being employed as part of a broader and expanding money economy.	73	80
held	DYNAMIC	The economic doctrine that held sway between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries is commonly described as mercantilism.	27	30
have	DYNAMIC	Mercantilists argued that a state should export more goods than it imported so that foreigners would have to pay the difference in precious metals.	101	104
characterized	STATIVE	These companies were characterized by their colonial and expansionary powers given to them by nation-states.	21	33
invested	DYNAMIC	During this era, merchants, who had traded under the previous stage of mercantilism, invested capital in the East India Companies and other colonies, seeking a return on investment.	85	92
embraced	STATIVE	Britain also abandoned its protectionist policy, as embraced by mercantilism.	52	59
shaped	STATIVE	Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism.	44	49
incorporated	DYNAMIC	It was in this period that areas of sub-Saharan Africa and the Pacific islands were incorporated into the world system.	84	95
allowed	DYNAMIC	New technologies, such as the telegraph, the transatlantic cable, the Radiotelephone, the steamship and railway allowed goods and information to move around the world at an unprecedented degree.	112	118
following	STATIVE	In the period following the global depression of the 1930s, the state played an increasingly prominent role in the capitalistic system throughout much of the world.	14	22
influenced	STATIVE	The post war era was greatly influenced by Keynesian economic stabilization policies.	29	38
called	STATIVE	"Public and political interest began shifting away from the so-called collectivist concerns of Keynes's managed capitalism to a focus on individual choice, called ""remarketized capitalism."""	155	160
distinguish	STATIVE	The extent to which the price mechanism is used, the degree of competitiveness, the balance between the public sector and the private sector, and the extent of government intervention in markets are the factors which distinguish several forms of capitalism in the modern world.	217	227
continue	STATIVE	In mixed economies, which are almost universal today, markets continue to play a dominant role but are regulated to some extent by government in order to correct market failures, promote social welfare, conserve natural resources, fund defense and public safety or for other reasons.	62	69
contrasted	DYNAMIC	Capitalism and capitalist economics is often contrasted with socialism, though the meaning of the word socialism has changed over time.	45	54
serves	DYNAMIC	Money is primarily a standardized medium of exchange, and final means of payment, that serves to measure the value of all goods and commodities in a standard of value.	87	92
called	STATIVE	In Marxian economic theory, this dynamic is called the law of value.	44	49
called	STATIVE	In Marxian economics these owners of the means of production and suppliers of capital are generally called capitalists.	100	105
referring	STATIVE	The description of the role of the capitalist has shifted, first referring to a useless intermediary between producers to an employer of producers, and eventually came to refer to owners of the means of production.	65	73
adapted	STATIVE	Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with strong, flexible bodies, quick reflexes, sharp retractable claws, and teeth adapted to killing small prey.	130	136
descended	STATIVE	A genetic study in 2007 concluded that domestic cats are descended from African wildcats (Felis silvestris lybica) c. 8000 BC, in West Asia.	57	65
found	STATIVE	Cats are the most popular pet in the world, and are now found in almost every place where humans live.	56	60
referred	STATIVE	"Although spayed females have no commonly used name, in some rare instances immature or spayed females are referred to as a ""molly""."	106	113
recorded	STATIVE	A pedigreed cat is one whose ancestry is recorded by a cat fancier organization.	41	48
found	STATIVE	Members of the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia, European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese mountain cat (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.	25	29
classified	STATIVE	the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the North African variety F. s. lybica.	38	47
poses	STATIVE	This hybridization poses a danger to the genetic distinctiveness of wildcat populations, particularly in Scotland and Hungary, and possibly also the Iberian Peninsula.	19	23
classified	DYNAMIC	The domestic cat was first classified as Felis catus by Carolus Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae in 1758.	27	36
called	DYNAMIC	This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus.	74	79
referred	DYNAMIC	Wildcats have also been referred to as various subspecies of F. catus, but in 2003 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris.	24	31
following	DYNAMIC	The most common name in use for the domestic cat remains F. catus, following a convention for domesticated animals of using the earliest (the senior) synonym proposed.	67	75
distinguishing	STATIVE	This limited evolution during domestication means that domestic cats tend to interbreed freely with wild relatives, distinguishing them from other domesticated animals.	116	129
classified	DYNAMIC	There is a population of Transcaucasian Black feral cats once classified as Felis daemon (Satunin, 1904), but now this population is considered to be a part of domestic cat.	62	71
allows	STATIVE	The high level of similarity among the metabolisms of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases.	62	67
weighed	STATIVE	The smallest adult cat ever officially recorded weighed around .	48	54
do	STATIVE	Cats have seven cervical vertebrae as do almost all mammals; 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae like most mammals (humans have five because of their bipedal posture); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans retain three to five caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx).	38	39
account	STATIVE	The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility.	40	46
making	STATIVE	They walk directly on their toes, with the bones of their feet making up the lower part of the visible leg.	63	68
shared	STATIVE	This trait is shared with camels and giraffes.	14	19
extend	DYNAMIC	Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws.	21	26
extend	DYNAMIC	They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces.	9	14
appears	STATIVE	"More proximally, there is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth ""finger""."	45	51
found	STATIVE	This special feature of the front paws, on the inside of the wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and of dogs.	93	97
studies	STATIVE	Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter.	47	53
studies	STATIVE	As such, chemistry studies the involvement of electrons and various forms of energy in photochemical reactions, oxidation-reduction reactions, changes in phases of matter, and separation of mixtures.	19	25
considered	DYNAMIC	Preparation and properties of complex substances, such as alloys, polymers, biological molecules, and pharmaceutical agents are considered in specialized fields of chemistry.	128	137
called	DYNAMIC	Chemistry is sometimes called the central science because it bridges other natural sciences like physics, geology and biology.	23	28
been	DYNAMIC	The etymology of the word chemistry has been much disputed.	40	43
traced	DYNAMIC	The history of chemistry can be traced to certain practices, known as alchemy, which had been practiced for several millennia in various parts of the world.	32	37
comes	STATIVE	The word chemistry comes from the word alchemy, an earlier set of practices that encompassed elements of chemistry, metallurgy, philosophy, astrology, astronomy, mysticism and medicine; it is commonly thought of as the quest to turn lead or another common starting material into gold.	19	23
called	STATIVE	"An alchemist was called a 'chemist' in popular speech, and later the suffix ""-ry"" was added to this to describe the art of the chemist as ""chemistry""."	17	22
derived	STATIVE	The word alchemy in turn is derived from the Arabic word al-kīmīā (الکیمیاء).	28	34
borrowed	STATIVE	In origin, the term is borrowed from the Greek χημία or χημεία.	23	30
derived	STATIVE	Many believe that al-kīmīā is derived from the Greek χημία, which is in turn derived from the word Chemi or Kimi, which is the ancient name of Egypt in Egyptian.	30	36
derived	STATIVE	"Alternately, al-kīmīā may be derived from χημεία, meaning ""cast together""."	29	35
composed	STATIVE	English scientist John Dalton proposed the modern theory of atoms; that all substances are composed of indivisible 'atoms' of matter and that different atoms have varying atomic weights.	91	98
called	DYNAMIC	The inert gases, later called the noble gases were discovered by William Ramsay in collaboration with Lord Rayleigh at the end of the century, thereby filling in the basic structure of the table.	23	28
following	STATIVE	Organic chemistry was developed by Justus von Liebig and others, following Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were, in theory, reducible to chemistry.	65	73
understood	DYNAMIC	At the turn of the twentieth century the theoretical underpinnings of chemistry were finally understood due to a series of remarkable discoveries that succeeded in probing and discovering the very nature of the internal structure of atoms.	93	102
investigated	DYNAMIC	In 1897, J. J. Thomson of Cambridge University discovered the electron and soon after the French scientist Becquerel as well as the couple Pierre and Marie Curie investigated the phenomenon of radioactivity.	162	173
classified	DYNAMIC	In a series of pioneering scattering experiments Ernest Rutherford at the University of Manchester discovered the internal structure of the atom and the existence of the proton, classified and explained the different types of radioactivity and successfully transmuted the first element by bombarding nitrogen with alpha particles.	178	187
called	STATIVE	A body of singers who perform together as a group is called a choir or chorus.	53	58
called	STATIVE	"Singing without accompaniment is called a cappella singing (although the American Choral Directors Association discourages this usage in favor of ""unaccompanied,"" since a cappella denotes singing ""as in the chapel"" and much unaccompanied music today is secular)."	33	38
planned	STATIVE	Accompanying instruments vary widely, from only one to a full orchestra; for rehearsals a piano or organ accompaniment is often used, even if a different instrumentation is planned for performance, or if the choir is rehearsing unaccompanied music.	173	179
allow	DYNAMIC	In smaller choirs with fewer men, SAB, or Soprano, Alto, and Baritone arrangements allow the few men to share the role of both the tenor and bass in a single part.	83	87
called	DYNAMIC	* Male choirs, with the same SATB voicing as mixed choirs, but with boys singing the upper part (often called trebles or boy sopranos) and men singing alto (in falsetto), also known as countertenors.	103	108
called	STATIVE	The clavichord produces sound by striking brass or iron strings with small metal blades called tangents.	88	93
derived	STATIVE	"The name is derived from the Latin word clavis, meaning ""key"" (associated with more common clavus, meaning ""nail, rod, etc."")"	12	18
dated	STATIVE	One of the earliest references to the clavichord in England occurs in the privy-purse expenses of Elizabeth of York, queen of Henry VII, in an entry dated August 1502:	149	153
featured	DYNAMIC	"Amos also featured her use of the Clavinet on her 2004 recording ""Not David Bowie"", released as part of her 2006 box set, A Piano: The Collection."	10	17
arranged	STATIVE	The strings, which are usually of brass, or else a combination of brass and iron, are usually arranged in pairs, like a lute or mandolin.	94	101
held	STATIVE	Unlike in a piano action, the tangent does not rebound from the string; rather, it stays in contact with the string as long as the key is held, acting as both the nut and as the initiator of sound.	138	142
referred	DYNAMIC	Because of this intimate contact between the player's hand and the production of sound, the clavichord has been referred to as the most intimate of keyboard instruments.	112	119
called	STATIVE	This is called fretting.	8	13
going	STATIVE	Early clavichords frequently had many notes played on each string, even going so far as the keyed monochord &mdash; an instrument with only one string—though most clavichords were triple- or double-fretted.	72	76
affects	STATIVE	Color blindness affects a significant percentage of the population.	16	22
perceive	DYNAMIC	The most usual cause is a fault in the development of one or more sets of retinal cones that perceive color in light and transmit that information to the optic nerve.	93	100
carried	STATIVE	The genes that produce photopigments are carried on the X chromosome; if some of these genes are missing or damaged, color blindness will be expressed in males with a higher probability than in females because males only have one X chromosome (in females, a functional gene on only one of the two X chromosomes is sufficient to yield the needed photopigments).	41	47
suffer	STATIVE	For example, people with achromatopsia suffer from a completely different disorder, but are nevertheless unable to see colors.	39	44
called	DYNAMIC	Because of Dalton's work, the general condition has been called daltonism, although in English this term is now used more narrowly for deuteranopia alone.	57	62
classified	DYNAMIC	Color blindness is usually classified as a mild disability, however there are occasional circumstances where it can give an advantage.	27	36
affects	STATIVE	Color blindness affects a large number of individuals, with protanopia and deuteranopia being the most common types.	16	22
called	DYNAMIC	These receptors are often called S cones, M cones, and L cones, for short, medium, and long wavelength; but they are also often referred to as blue cones, green cones, and red cones, respectively.	26	31
is	DYNAMIC	"Although these receptors are often referred to as ""blue, green, and red"" receptors, this terminology is inaccurate."	101	102
making	STATIVE	Many of the genes involved in color vision are on the X chromosome, making color blindness much more common in males than in females because males only have one X chromosome, while females have two.	68	73
provides	STATIVE	Because this is an X-linked trait, an estimated 2–3% of women have a 4th color cone and can be considered tetrachromats, although it is not clear that this provides an advantage in color discrimination.	156	163
classified	DYNAMIC	Color vision deficiencies can be classified as acquired or inherited.	33	42
were	DYNAMIC	"**Monochromacy, also known as ""total color blindness"", is the lack of ability to distinguish colors (and thus the person views everything as if it were on a black and white television); caused by cone defect or absence."	147	150
accompanied	STATIVE	***Cone monochromacy is a rare total color blindness that is accompanied by relatively normal vision, electroretinogram, and electrooculogram.	61	71
reduced	STATIVE	Dichromacy occurs when one of the cone pigments is missing and color is reduced to two dimensions.	72	78
perceive	DYNAMIC	It is a form of dichromatism in which the subject can only perceive light wavelengths from 400 to 650 nm, instead of the usual 700 nm.	59	66
permit	DYNAMIC	Some looser confederations are similar to intergovernmental organizations and even may permit secession from the confederation.	87	92
called	DYNAMIC	"For example, C. E. Lagasse declared that Belgium was ""near the political system of a Confederation"" regarding the agreements between Belgian regions and communities, while Centre de recherche et d'information socio-politiques (CRISP) director Vincent de Coorebyter called Belgium ""undoubtedly a federation...[with] some aspects of a confederation"" in Le Soir."	265	270
dominates	STATIVE	Also for fiscal policy and public finances, the federal state dominates the other levels of government.	62	70
appear	STATIVE	The limited confederal aspects appear to be a meager political reflection of the profound sociological, cultural and economic differences between Flemings and Walloons (or French-speaking Belgians).	31	36
makes	STATIVE	This makes Belgium fundamentally different from federal countries like Switzerland, Canada, Germany and Australia.	5	9
bear	STATIVE	"However, it does bear some resemblance to both a confederation (or ""new"" type of confederation) and a federation."	17	20
enable	STATIVE	The EU operates common economic policies with hundreds of common laws, which enable a single economic market, open internal borders, a common currency and allow for numerous other areas where powers have been transferred and directly applicable laws are made.	77	82
accounted	STATIVE	Furthermore, laws sometimes must be transcribed into national law by national parliaments; decisions by member states are taken by special majorities with blocking minorities accounted for; and treaty amendment requires ratification by every member state before it can come into force.	175	183
discuss	DYNAMIC	However, academic observers more usually discuss the EU in the terms of it being a federation.	41	47
see	STATIVE	Jean-Michel Josselin and Alain Marciano see the European Court of Justice as being a primary force behind building a federal legal order in the Union[http://www.springerlink.com/content/f3vw032557232l64/ How the [ECJ] court made a federation of the EU] Josselin (U de Rennes-1/CREM) and Marciano (U de Reims CA/CNRS).	40	42
stating	DYNAMIC	"with Josselin stating that a ""complete shift from a confederation to a federation would have required to straightforwardly replace the principality of the member states vis-à-vis the Union by that of the European citizens...As a consequence, both confederate and federate features coexist in the judicial landscape""."	14	20
claim	STATIVE	"Thomas Risse and Tanja A. Börzel claim that the ""EU only lacks two significant features of a federation."	33	37
provide	STATIVE	They may also provide additional protection for those most vulnerable in society.	14	20
defined	STATIVE	A consumer is defined as someone who acquires goods or services for direct use or ownership rather than for resale or use in production and manufacturing.	14	20
affects	DYNAMIC	When issuing public warnings about products and services, the issuing authority has to take into account that this affects the supplier's constitutionally protected economic liberty, see Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) Case 3 C 34.84, 71 BVerwGE 183).	115	121
influenced	STATIVE	Modern Taiwanese law has been heavily influenced by European civil law systems, particularly German and Swiss law.	38	47
serves	STATIVE	The Consumer Protection Commission of Executive Yuan serves as an ombudsman supervising, coordinating, reporting any unsafe products/services and periodically reviewing the legislation.	53	58
complain	STATIVE	However, consumers cannot directly complain to the OFT.	35	42
investigated	DYNAMIC	Due to restrictions within the Enterprise Act 2002, individual complainants are unable to be told whether their case is being investigated or not.	126	137
preferring	DYNAMIC	The OFT rarely prosecute companies, however, preferring a light touch regulation approach.	45	54
leads	STATIVE	This leads to a problem in that these examples of legislation are clearly designed to deal with individual complaints but the OFT will only deal with systemic complaints and will ignore individual complainants redirecting them back to Consumer Direct.	5	9
acts	STATIVE	The Office of Fair Trading also acts as the UK's official consumer and competition watchdog, with a remit to make markets work well for consumers, and at a local, municipal level by Trading Standards departments.	32	35
appears	DYNAMIC	CDCA auto repair notice.jpg|thumb|Consumer protection laws often mandate the posting of notices, such as this one which appears in all automotive repair shops in California	120	126
devoted	STATIVE	Also, the majority of states have a Department of Consumer Affairs devoted to regulating certain industries and protecting consumers who use goods and services from those industries.	67	73
encourages	DYNAMIC	In addition, California encourages its consumers to act as private attorneys general through the liberal provisions of its Consumers Legal Remedies Act,	24	33
written	STATIVE	For example Florida, Delaware and Minnesota have legislated requirements that contracts be written at reasonable readability levels as a large proportion of contracts cannot be understood by most consumers who sign them.	91	97
classified	STATIVE	They are a prominent modern member of the subfamily Bovinae, are the most widespread species of the genus Bos, and are most commonly classified collectively as Bos taurus.	133	142
leading	STATIVE	Hybrids such as the beefalo breed can even occur between taurine cattle and either species of bison, leading some authors to consider them part of the genus Bos, as well.	101	107
ranged	STATIVE	The aurochs originally ranged throughout Europe, North Africa, and much of Asia.	23	28
originate	DYNAMIC	Cattle did not originate as the term for bovine animals.	15	23
opposed	STATIVE	It was borrowed from Anglo-Norman xno, itself from Latin la, head, and originally meant movable personal property, especially livestock of any kind, as opposed to real property (the land, which also included wild or small free-roaming animals such as chickens — they were sold as part of the land).	152	158
refer	STATIVE	Wild cattle may refer to feral cattle or to undomesticated species of the genus Bos.	16	20
called	STATIVE	"* An ""intact"" (i.e., not castrated) adult male is called a bull."	50	55
called	STATIVE	"An unbranded bovine of either sex is called a ""maverick"" in the USA and Canada."	37	42
had	DYNAMIC	* An adult female that has had a calf (or two, depending on regional usage) is a cow.	27	29
called	STATIVE	A young female that has had only one calf is occasionally called a first-calf heifer.	58	63
called	STATIVE	In North America, draft cattle under four years old are called working steers.	56	61
results	DYNAMIC	Improper or late castration on a bull results in it becoming a coarse steer known as a stag in Australia, Canada and New Zealand.	38	44
called	STATIVE	"* A castrated male (occasionally a female or in some areas a bull) kept for draft purposes is called an ox (plural oxen); ""ox"" may also be used to refer to some carcass products from any adult cattle, such as ox-hide, ox-blood, oxtail, or ox-liver."	94	99
called	STATIVE	* In all cattle species, a female twin of a bull usually becomes an infertile partial intersex, and is called a freemartin.	103	108
called	STATIVE	* Cattle raised for human consumption are called beef cattle.	42	47
refer	DYNAMIC	"Thus one may refer to ""three cattle"" or ""some cattle"", but not ""one cattle""."	13	17
does	STATIVE	"Merriam-Webster, a US dictionary, recognizes the sex-nonspecific use of ""cow"" as an alternate definition, whereas Collins, a UK dictionary, does not."	140	143
called	STATIVE	"In some areas of the American South (particularly the Appalachian region), where both dairy and beef cattle are present, an individual animal was once called a ""beef critter"", though that term is becoming archaic."	151	156
called	STATIVE	"Cattle raised for human consumption are called ""beef cattle""."	40	45
called	STATIVE	"Cows of certain breeds that are kept for the milk they give are called ""dairy cows"" or ""milking cows"" (formerly ""milch cows"")."	64	69
called	STATIVE	"In some places, a cow kept to provide milk for one family is called a ""house cow""."	61	66
extracted	DYNAMIC	"Other obsolete terms for cattle include ""neat"" (this use survives in ""neatsfoot oil"", extracted from the feet and legs of cattle), and ""beefing"" (young animal fit for slaughter)."	86	94
called	STATIVE	"An onomatopoeic term for one of the most common sounds made by cattle is ""moo"" (also called lowing)."	85	90
allowed	DYNAMIC	Careful genetic selection has allowed polled (hornless) cattle to become widespread.	30	36
allow	STATIVE	These features allow cattle to thrive on grasses and other vegetation.	15	19
run	STATIVE	Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens are meant to participate equallyin the proposal, development and establishment of the laws by which their society is run.	182	185
specify	DYNAMIC	The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another: many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can co-exist in a single system.	72	78
combined	STATIVE	Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of participatory democracy and/or workplace democracy combined with a representative democracy.	120	127
refer	DYNAMIC	"Within Marxist orthodoxy there is a hostility to what is commonly called ""liberal democracy"", which they simply refer to as parliamentary democracy because of its often centralised nature."	112	116
called	DYNAMIC	Because of their desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism, Marxists, Leninists and Trotskyists believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of communes (which are sometimes called soviets).	209	214
manifests	DYNAMIC	This system ultimately manifests itself as council democracy and begins with workplace democracy.	23	31
split	STATIVE	Anarchists are split in this domain, depending on whether they believe that a majority-rule is tyrannic or not.	15	19
recognised	STATIVE	Pierre-Joseph Proudhon argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority, even when unanimous.	102	111
rules	STATIVE	Despotism is a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power.	59	63
comes	STATIVE	"Despot comes from the Greek despotes, which roughly means ""master"" or ""one with power"", and it has been used to translate a wide variety of titles and positions."	7	11
tends	STATIVE	Dictator has also developed nearly similar pejorative connotations, though despot and tyrant tend to stress cruelty and even enjoyment therefrom, while dictator tends to imply more harshness or unfair implementation of law.	161	165
implies	STATIVE	The term now implies tyrannical rule.	13	19
comes	STATIVE	According to Gyula Moravcsik, this title was a simple translation of Béla's Hungarian title úr, but other historians believe it comes from the ancient Greek despotes (literally, the master).	128	132
called	STATIVE	Despots ruled over parts of the empire called Despotates.	39	44
championing	DYNAMIC	"Between the two world wars, four types of dictatorships have been described: constitutional, communist (nominally championing ""dictatorship of the proletariat""), counterrevolutionary, and fascist, and many have questioned the distinctions among these prototypes."	114	124
inherited	STATIVE	After World War II, dictators established themselves in the several new states of Africa and Asia, often at the expense or failure of the constitutions inherited from the colonial powers.	152	160
seen	STATIVE	The DD index is seen as an example of the minimalist approach, whereas the Polity data series, relatively more substantive.	16	19
rules	DYNAMIC	The most general term is despotism, a form of government in which a single entity rules with absolute power.	82	86
led	STATIVE	"Totalitarian dictatorships involve a ""single party led by a single powerful individual with a powerful secret police and a highly developed ideology."""	51	53
seeks	DYNAMIC	Juan Linz argues that the distinction between an authoritarian regime and a totalitarian one is that while an authoritarian one seeks to suffocate politics and political mobilization (depoliticization), a totalitarian one seeks to control politics and political mobilization.	128	132
refer	STATIVE	"The word ""dog"" can also refer to the male of a canine species, as opposed to the word ""bitch"" which refers to the female of the species."	24	28
dates	DYNAMIC	A study of fossil dogs and wolves in Belgium, Ukraine, and Russia tentatively dates domestication from 14,000 years ago to more than 31,700 years ago.	78	82
estimated	STATIVE	In 2001, there were estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.	20	28
shows	STATIVE	Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.	91	95
refer	STATIVE	"The term can also be used to refer to a wider range of related species, such as the members of the genus Canis, or ""true dogs"", including the wolf, coyote, and jackals, or it can refer to the members of the tribe Canini, which would also include the African wild dog, or it can be used to refer to any member of the family Canidae, which would also include the foxes, bush dog, raccoon dog, and others."	29	33
comes	STATIVE	"The English word dog comes from Middle English dogge, from Old English docga, a ""powerful dog breed""."	21	25
referred	STATIVE	In 14th-century England, hound (from hund) was the general word for all domestic canines, and dog referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff.	98	105
called	STATIVE	In breeding circles, a male canine is referred to as a dog, while a female is called a bitch (Middle English bicche, from Old English bicce, ultimately from Old Norse bikkja).	78	83
called	STATIVE	The father of a litter is called the sire, and the mother is called the dam.	26	31
listed	DYNAMIC	In 1753, the father of modern biological taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, listed among the types of quadrupeds familiar to him, the Latin word for dog, canis.	66	71
listed	DYNAMIC	Among the species within this genus, Linnaeus listed the fox, as Canis vulpes, wolves (Canis lupus), and the domestic dog, (Canis canis).	46	51
recommended	STATIVE	C. l. familiaris is listed as the name for the taxon that is broadly used in the scientific community and recommended by ITIS, although Canis familiaris is a recognised synonym.	106	116
listed	DYNAMIC	Since that time, C. domesticus and all taxa referring to domestic dogs or subspecies of dog listed by Linnaeus, Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1792, and Christian Smith in 1839, lost their subspecies status and have been listed as taxonomic synonyms for Canis lupus familiaris.	92	97
descended	STATIVE	jpg|thumb|Domestic dogs are descended from gray wolves.	28	36
inherited	DYNAMIC	Domestic dogs inherited complex behaviors from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language.	14	22
enabled	STATIVE	These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.	250	256
agreed	STATIVE	Although experts largely disagree over the details of dog domestication, it is agreed that human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies.	79	84
shows	STATIVE	The current consensus among biologists and archaeologists is that the dating of first domestication is indeterminate, although more recent evidence shows isolated domestication events as early as 33,000 years ago.	148	152
demonstrates	DYNAMIC	The divergence date of roughly 15,000 years ago is based in part on archaeological evidence that demonstrates the domestication of dogs occurred more than 15,000 years ago, and some genetic evidence indicates the domestication of dogs from their wolf ancestors began in the late Upper Paleolithic close to the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, between 17,000 and 14,000 years ago.	97	108
evidenced	STATIVE	There are findings beginning currently at 33,000 years ago distinctly placing them as domesticated dogs evidenced not only by shortening of the muzzle but widening as well as crowding of teeth.	104	112
suggests	STATIVE	Archaeological evidence suggests that the latest point at which dogs could have diverged from wolves was roughly 15,000 years ago, although it is possible they diverged much earlier.	24	31
including	DYNAMIC	Remains of smaller dogs from Natufian cave deposits in the Middle East, including the earliest burial of a human being with a domestic dog, have been dated to around 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.	72	80
dated	DYNAMIC	The oldest remains of a domesticated dog in the Americas were found in Texas and have been dated to about 9,400 years ago.	91	95
use	STATIVE	Some estimates of divergence dates from DNA evidence use an estimated wolf–coyote divergence date of roughly 700,000 years ago as a calibration.	53	55
suggest	STATIVE	Data suggest dogs first diverged from wolves in East Asia, and these domesticated dogs then quickly migrated throughout the world, reaching the North American continent around 8000 BC.	5	11
show	STATIVE	The oldest groups of dogs, which show the greatest genetic variability and are the most similar to their wolf ancestors, are primarily Asian and African breeds, including the Basenji, Lhasa Apso, and Siberian Husky.	33	36
claimed	STATIVE	"Although it is widely claimed that ""man domesticated the wolf,"" man might not have taken such a proactive role in the process."	22	28
united	STATIVE	An empire is a geographically extensive group of states and peoples (ethnic groups) united and ruled by a central authority, either by a monarch (emperor, empress) or an oligarchy.	84	89
derived	STATIVE	The term empire is derived from the Latin term imperium (a rule, a command; authority, control, power; supreme power, sole dominion; military authority; a dominion, realm) from imperare (to command).	19	25
limits	DYNAMIC	The former method provides greater tribute and direct political control, yet limits further expansion because it absorbs military forces to fixed garrisons.	77	82
composed	STATIVE	This is in contrast to a federation, which is an extensive state voluntarily composed of autonomous states and peoples.	77	84
affecting	STATIVE	It might be a state affecting imperial policies or a particular political structure.	20	28
composed	STATIVE	The terrestrial empire's maritime analogue is the thalassocracy, an empire composed of islands and coasts which are accessible to its terrestrial homeland, such as the Athenian-dominated Delian League.	75	82
maintained	STATIVE	If governmental authority was maintained by controlling water supplies, vital to colonial subjects, such régimes were called hydraulic empires.	30	39
leading	DYNAMIC	"Europeans began applying the designation of ""empire"" to non-European monarchies, such as the Qing dynasty and the Mughal Empire, as well as the Maratha Empire, eventually leading to the looser denotations applicable to any political structure meeting the criteria of ""imperium""."	171	177
styled	DYNAMIC	Some empires styled themselves as having greater size, scope, and power than the territorial, politico-military, and economic facts support.	13	18
renamed	DYNAMIC	"and renamed their states as ""The Empire of ...."""	4	10
lasted	DYNAMIC	By the 6th century BC, after having allied with the Babylonians to defeat the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Medes were able to establish their own empire, which was the largest of its day and lasted for about sixty years.	187	192
absorbed	STATIVE	The successful, extensive, and multi-cultural Achaemenid Empire (550–330 BC), also known as the first Persian Empire, absorbed Mesopotamia, Egypt, parts of Greece, Thrace, the Middle East, much of Central Asia, and Pakistan, until it was overthrown and replaced by the short-lived empire of Alexander the Great.	118	125
ruled	STATIVE	The Maurya Empire was a geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321-185 BC.	87	91
following	DYNAMIC	The empire was founded in 322 BC by Chandragupta Maurya, who rapidly expanded his power westward across central and western India, taking advantage of the disruptions of local powers following the withdrawal by Alexander the Great.	183	191
had	DYNAMIC	By 320 BC, the Maurya Empire had fully occupied northwestern India as well as defeating and conquering the satraps left by Alexander.	29	31
called	DYNAMIC	Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin.	74	79
referring	DYNAMIC	Lira spread widely westward to Europe; in the 11th and 12th centuries European writers use the terms fiddle and lira interchangeably when referring to bowed instruments (Encyclopædia Britannica.	138	146
bears	STATIVE	The [Teutonic] word bears a singular resemblance in sound to its Latin synonym vitula, vidula, whence French viole, Pr.	20	24
referred	STATIVE	Historically, fiddle also referred to a predecessor of today's violin.	26	33
held	STATIVE	Another family of instruments that contributed to the development of the modern fiddle are the viols, which are held between the legs and played vertically, and have fretted fingerboards.	112	115
represented	DYNAMIC	In performance, a solo fiddler, or one fiddler or two with a group of other instrumentalists, is the norm, though twin fiddling is represented in some North American, Scandinavian, Scottish and Irish styles.	131	141
grouped	DYNAMIC	Violins, on the other hand, are commonly grouped in sections.	41	47
did	STATIVE	These contrasting traditions may be vestiges of historical performance settings: large concert halls where violins were played required more instruments, before electronic amplification, than did more intimate dance halls and houses that fiddlers played in.	192	194
detailed	DYNAMIC	(Different fiddle traditions have different values, as detailed below.	55	62
present	DYNAMIC	These explanations present the differences between fiddle music and other violin music.)	19	25
accompanied	DYNAMIC	Hungarian, Slovenian, and Romanian fiddle players are often accompanied by a three-stringed variant of the viola—known as the kontra—and by double bass, with cimbalom and clarinet being less standard yet still common additions to a band.	60	70
makes	STATIVE	In Hungary, a three stringed viola variant with a flat bridge, called the kontra or háromhúros brácsa makes up part of a traditional rhythm section in Hungarian folk music.	102	106
characterized	STATIVE	To a greater extent than classical violin playing, fiddle playing is characterized by a huge variety of ethnic or folk music traditions, each of which has its own distinctive sound.	69	81
included	DYNAMIC	Such prevailing factors that have been studied in the past have included metaphysical constraints (such as logical, nomological, or theological determinism), physical constraints (such as chains or imprisonment), social constraints (such as threat of punishment or censure), and mental constraints (such as compulsions or phobias, neurological disorders, or genetic predispositions).	64	71
implies	STATIVE	For example, in the religious realm, free will implies that individual will and choices can coexist with an omnipotent, omniscient divinity that raises certain injunctions or moral obligations for man.	47	53
affects	STATIVE	In the law, it affects considerations of punishment and rehabilitation.	15	21
suggest	STATIVE	In science, neuroscientific findings regarding free will may suggest different ways of predicting human behavior.	61	67
named	DYNAMIC	Historically, the constraint of dominant concern has been determinism of some variety (such as logical, nomological, or theological), so the most prominent common positions are named for the relation they hold to exist between free will and determinism.	177	181
felt	DYNAMIC	The conflict between intuitively felt freedom and natural law arises when either causal closure or physical determinism (nomological determinism) is asserted.	33	36
saw	STATIVE	"The connection between autonomy (self-determination) and the ideal of developing one's own individual self was adopted within the psychology of Abraham Maslow, who saw the goal of human development as ""self-actualization""."	164	166
allows	DYNAMIC	For others, true free will must involve self-realization, which is a maturing of the self that allows the dissolution of one's counter-productive obsessive, internal pre-occupations and assumptions, including unrecognized peer-pressure and the like, all of which reduce our actual choices, thus reduce our freedom.	95	100
constrained	DYNAMIC	Physical models offered at present are both deterministic and indeterministic, and are subject to interpretations of quantum mechanics - which themselves are being constrained by ongoing experimentation.	164	174
embraced	DYNAMIC	This view was universally embraced by both incompatibilists and compatibilists.	26	33
have	DYNAMIC	"For example, the laws of physics (deterministic or not) have yet to resolve the hard problem of consciousness: ""Solving the hard problem of consciousness involves determining how physiological processes such as ions flowing across the nerve membrane cause us to have experiences."""	56	59
including	DYNAMIC	"Although incompatibilist metaphysical libertarianism generally represents the bulk of non-materialist constructions, including the popular claim of being able to consciously veto an action or competing desire, compatibilist theories have been developed based on a form of identity dualism in which ""the experience of conscious free will is the first-person perspective of the neural correlates of choosing."""	117	125
treated	STATIVE	Free will here is predominately treated with respect to physical determinism in the strict sense of nomological determinism, although other forms of determinism are also relevant to free will.	32	38
places	DYNAMIC	"If he has none, Alice is told to ""go fish,"" and she draws a card from the pool and places it in her own hand."	83	88
forms	DYNAMIC	When any player at any time has all four cards of one rank, it forms a book, and the cards must be placed face up in front of that player.	63	67
form	DYNAMIC	* Players form and lay down pairs.	10	13
wait	DYNAMIC	* A player who runs out of cards must wait until the game is over and cannot gain any more cards or books.	38	41
runs	STATIVE	If playing after the winner has already been decided the next place is given to the player who has the most books first, not the player that runs out of cards.	141	144
find	STATIVE	Occasionally circumstances arise where normally opposing parties may find it desirable to form a government.	69	72
comes	STATIVE	The root of the term comes from the word to make sound in the wind.	21	25
associated	DYNAMIC	The term was eventually associated with the trapezoidal Gusli-psaltyry (which may have originated in Byzantium).	24	33
named	STATIVE	During the war at the end of the 6th century, the Greeks took Slavonic prisoners and found a musical instrument named the Gusli.	112	116
states	DYNAMIC	Vertkov states that the first mentions of the Gusli date back to 591 AD to a treatise by the Greek historian Theophylact Simocatta which describes the instrument being used by Slavs from the area of the later Kievan Rus' kingdom.	8	13
tuned	DYNAMIC	Folk Gusli have from eleven to thirty-six gut or metal strings, tuned diatonically.	64	68
held	STATIVE	Shlemovidnye gusli (Helmet-shaped gusli; Шлемовидные гусли) is a variety of Gusli held by the musician on his knees, so that the strings are horizontal, the resonator body under them.	82	85
spread	STATIVE	The instrument was spread in southern and western regions of Kievan Rus'.	19	24
held	STATIVE	They are held much more like modern guitars (although the strings are still muted by the left hand through a special opening in the instrument's body).	9	12
tuned	DYNAMIC	"The Clavichord Gusli Gusli"" | (Клавирообразные гусли) is a 19th-century derivative with an iron frame and metal strings tuned chromatically."	120	124
allow	DYNAMIC	Pressing the keys of the keyboard would raise the dampers on specific strings and allow the player to play glissandi and arpeggios over the range of the strings.	82	86
refer	STATIVE	In western Ukraine and Belarus, husli can also refer to a fiddle or even a ducted flute.	47	51
make	STATIVE	Together these instruments make up the family known as Baltic psalteries.	27	30
influenced	DYNAMIC	In Ukraine, it is thought that the gusli may have influenced the development of the multi-stringed bandura, which largely replaced it in the nineteenth century.	50	59
stored	STATIVE	To prevent an opened container of glue from setting before use, it must be stored in an airtight jar or bottle with a package of silica gel.	75	80
attaching	STATIVE	Another convenient way is attaching a hypodermic needle on the opening of glue.	26	34
keeping	DYNAMIC	After applying, residual glue soon clogs the needle, keeping moisture out.	53	59
held	DYNAMIC	Coover held 460 patents, and Super Glue was just one of his many discoveries.	7	10
held	DYNAMIC	He also held the Earle B. Barnes Award for Leadership in Chemical Research Management, the Maurice Holland Award, the IRI Achievement Award, and was a medalist for the Industrial Research Institute.	8	11
denies	STATIVE	The Hells Angels' website denies the suggestion that any misfit or malcontent troops are connected with the motorcycle club.	26	31
notes	STATIVE	"The website also notes that the name was suggested by Arvid Olsen, an associate of the founders, who had served in the Flying Tigers' ""Hell's Angels"" squadron in China during World War II."	17	21
claim	DYNAMIC	"Other sources claim that the Hells Angels in San Francisco were originally organized in 1953 by Rocky Graves, a Hells Angel member from San Bernardino (""Berdoo"") implying that the ""Frisco"" Hells Angels were very much aware of their forebears."	14	18
used	STATIVE	"The Oakland chapter, at the time headed by Barger used a larger version of the ""Death's Head"" patch nicknamed the ""Barger Larger"" which was first used in 1959."	50	53
depicted	DYNAMIC	The Hells Angels are often depicted in a similarly mythical fashion as other modern-day legends like the James-Younger Gang; free-spirited, iconic, bound by brotherhood and loyalty.	27	34
depicted	DYNAMIC	At other times, such as in the 1966 Roger Corman film The Wild Angels where they are depicted as violent and nihilistic, they are portrayed as a violent criminal gang and a scourge on society.	85	92
identify	STATIVE	Although the specific meaning of each patch is not publicly known, the patches identify specific or significant actions or beliefs of each biker.	79	86

displaying	STATIVE	The diamond-shaped one-percenter patch is also used, displaying '1%', in red on a white background with a red merrowed border.	53	62
said	STATIVE	The term one-percenter is said to be a response to the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) comment on the Hollister incident, to the effect that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens and the last 1% were outlaws.	26	29
calls	STATIVE	The AMA has no record of such a statement to the press, and calls this story apocryphal.	60	64

protected	STATIVE	The lawsuit is also aimed at Saks Fifth Avenue and Zappos.com, which stock the jacquard box dress and knuckle duster ring which bear the symbol which has been used since at least 1948 and is protected by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.	191	199
named	DYNAMIC	A handbag and scarf was also named in lawsuit.	29	33
got	STATIVE	"If you've got one of these rings on, a member might get really upset that you're an impostor."""	10	12
originate	STATIVE	In its complaint, Hells Angels asserted that the mark used on the yo-yos is likely to confuse the public into mistakenly believing that the toys originate with Hells Angels and Yomega filed counterclaims against Hells Angels for cancellation of the “Death Head” registrations on grounds of alleged fraud in the procurement of the registrations.	145	153
allows	DYNAMIC	This process allows each voting member to become familiar with the subject and to ask any questions of concern prior to the vote.	13	18
follows	DYNAMIC	Some form of formal induction follows, wherein the prospect affirms his loyalty to the club and its members.	30	37
is	DYNAMIC	Even after a member is patched-in, the patches themselves remain the property of HAMC rather than the member.	20	21
spread	STATIVE	The HAMC acknowledges more than one hundred chapters spread over 29 countries.	53	58

made	STATIVE	The Burden Iron Works produced the first ship spikes, and the first horseshoes made by machinery in the world.	79	82
designed	DYNAMIC	"In 1835 he designed the ""Horseshoe Machine"" that could produce 60 shoes a minute."	11	18
held	STATIVE	"Also in 1840 he obtained a patent for the ""rotary squeezer"", which came to be used in all the leading iron manufactories in both America and Europe.Burden held twelve patents in total."	155	158
had	DYNAMIC	At great expense, Burden had the grounds filled in, and the river dredged, so that the company's docks were accessible to large vessels.	25	27
designed	DYNAMIC	In order to find the necessary power to run his foundry, in 1851 Burden designed and constructed a 60-foot wheel that could generate 500 horsepower.	72	79
characterized	DYNAMIC	"The poet Louis Gaylor Clark, characterized the huge whell as the ""Niagara of Water-Wheels,""."	29	41
suggested	STATIVE	Some idea of the magnitude of the ironworks at Troy is suggested by the fact that in 1864 the cost of iron, coal, and other materials was over $1,500,000.	55	63
employed	STATIVE	In 1880 the ironworks employed 1,400 men.	22	29
depicted	STATIVE	In ancient Egypt, herbs are mentioned in Egyptian medical papyri, depicted in tomb illustrations, or on rare occasions found in medical jars containing trace amounts of herbs.	66	73
survived	DYNAMIC	The earliest known Greek herbals were those of Diocles of Carystus, written during the 3rd century B.C, and one by Krateuas from the 1st century BC Only a few fragments of these works have survived intact, but from what remains scholars have noted that there is a large amount of overlap with the Egyptian herbals.	189	196
derived	DYNAMIC	According to the World Health Organization, approximately 25% of modern drugs used in the United States have been derived from plants.	114	120
derived	STATIVE	At least 7,000 medical compounds in the modern pharmacopoeia are derived from plants.	65	71
show	STATIVE	Among the 120 active compounds currently isolated from the higher plants and widely used in modern medicine today, 80% show a positive correlation between their modern therapeutic use and the traditional use of the plants from which they are derived.	119	122
discouraged	STATIVE	Strong evidence was found that 5 were toxic or allergenic, so that their use ought to be discouraged or forbidden.	89	99
focused	STATIVE	A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine focused on who used complementary and alternative medicines (CAM), what was used, and why it was used.	96	102
excluded	STATIVE	According to this survey, herbal therapy, or use of natural products other than vitamins and minerals, was the most commonly used CAM therapy (18.9%) when all use of prayer was excluded.	177	185
seen	STATIVE	Herbal remedies are seen by some as a treatment to be preferred to pure medical compounds that have been industrially produced.	20	23
dominated	DYNAMIC	"The popular understanding of Hinduism has been dominated by ""Hindu modernism"", in which mysticism and the unity of Hinduism have been emphasised."	47	55
classified	STATIVE	"Hindu texts are classified into Śruti (""heard"") and Smriti (""remembered"")."	16	25
discuss	STATIVE	These texts discuss theology, philosophy, mythology, Vedic yajna and agamic rituals and temple building, among other topics.	12	18
refer	STATIVE	The term 'Hindu' then was a geographical term and did not refer to a religion.	58	62
referred	STATIVE	The word Hindu was taken by European languages from the Arabic term al-Hind, which referred to the people who live across the River Indus.	83	90
shaped	DYNAMIC	"The study of India and its cultures and religions, and the definition of ""Hinduism"", has been shaped by the interests of colonialism and by Western notions of religion."	94	99
covered	DYNAMIC	Because of the wide range of traditions and ideas covered by the term, arriving at a comprehensive definition is difficult.	50	56
defined	DYNAMIC	"Hinduism has been variously defined as a religion, a religious tradition, a set of religious beliefs, and ""a way of life."""	28	34
covering	STATIVE	"In India the term dharma is preferred, which is more inclusive than the western term ""religion"", covering both ""religious"" and ""wordly"" aspects."	97	104
refer	DYNAMIC	"Many practitioners refer to Hinduism as , ""the eternal law"" or the ""eternal way""."	19	23
contrasted	STATIVE	"This is contrasted with svadharma, one's ""own duty"", the duties to be followed by members of a specific caste and stage of life."	8	17
seeing	STATIVE	"Central to his philosophy is the idea that the divine exists in all beings, that all human beings can achieve union with this ""innate divinity"", and that seeing this divine as the essence of others will further love and social harmony."	154	159
varied	STATIVE	The study seeks to define periods in human history where temperature or precipitation varied from what is observed in the present day.	86	91
appears	STATIVE	The start of our present interglacial period appears to have helped spur the development of human civilization.	45	51
comes	STATIVE	Evidence of a warm climate in Europe, for example, comes from archaeological studies of settlement and farming in the Early Bronze Age at altitudes now beyond cultivation, such as Dartmoor, Exmoor, the Lake district and the Pennines in England.	51	55
appears	STATIVE	The climate appears to have deteriorated towards the Late Bronze Age however.	12	18
recorded	STATIVE	Much of the information given in the Chronicle is not recorded elsewhere.	54	61
held	DYNAMIC	The River Thames and the canals and rivers of the Netherlands often froze over during the winter, and people skated and even held frost fairs on the ice.	125	128
fixed	STATIVE	The winter of 1794/1795 was particularly harsh when the French invasion army under Pichegru could march on the frozen rivers of the Netherlands, while the Dutch fleet was fixed in the ice in Den Helder harbour.	171	175
suffered	DYNAMIC	The population of Iceland fell by half, but this was perhaps also due to fluorosis caused by the eruption of the volcano Laki in 1783.Iceland also suffered failures of cereal crops and people moved away from a grain-based diet.	147	154
maintained	DYNAMIC	The Norse colonies in Greenland starved and vanished (by the 15th century) as crops failed and livestock could not be maintained through increasingly harsh winters, though Jared Diamond noted that they had exceeded the agricultural carrying capacity before then.	118	127
grouped	STATIVE	The Huli are grouped in clans (hamigini) and subclans (hamigini emene).	13	19
seen	STATIVE	Also, individuals that other cultures might label their 'aunts' and 'uncles', are seen by the Huli as their 'mothers' and 'fathers'.	82	85
wear	DYNAMIC	When wearing traditional dress, the men decorate their bodies with colored clay and wear elaborate headdresses for ceremonies.	84	87

express	STATIVE	Each makes individual headdresses that express the common elements of culture.	39	45
forbidden	STATIVE	Exogamy (where marriage is allowed only outside of a social group) is the norm, and marriage between close relatives is forbidden.	120	129
arranged	DYNAMIC	Marriages may be arranged, but couples may also choose to marry each other.	17	25
conceived	STATIVE	Human rights are thus conceived as universal (applicable everywhere) and egalitarian (the same for everyone).	22	30
is	DYNAMIC	One theory is that human rights were developed during the early Modern period, alongside the European secularization of Judeo-Christian ethics.	11	12
constituted	STATIVE	Medieval charters of liberty such as the English Magna Carta were not charters of human rights, rather they were the foundation and constituted a form of limited political and legal agreement to address specific political circumstances, in the case of Magna Carta later being recognised in the course of early modern debates about rights.	132	142
divided	STATIVE	In the Valladolid debate, Juan Ginés de Sepúlveda, who maintained an Aristotelian view of humanity as divided into classes of different worth, argued with Las Casas, who argued in favor of equal rights to freedom of slavery for all humans regardless of race or religion.	102	108
identifying	DYNAMIC	"17th-century English philosopher John Locke discussed natural rights in his work, identifying them as being ""life, liberty, and estate (property)"", and argued that such fundamental rights could not be surrendered in the social contract."	82	92
leading	DYNAMIC	Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the adoption of the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively, both of which established certain legal rights.	106	112
banning	DYNAMIC	These included the 13th amendment, banning slavery, the 14th amendment, assuring full citizenship and civil rights to all people born in the United States, and the 15th amendment, guaranteeing African Americans the right to vote.	35	41
establishing	DYNAMIC	In Europe and North America, labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labor.	100	111
following	STATIVE	The League of Nations was established in 1919 at the negotiations over the Treaty of Versailles following the end of World War I.	96	104
make	STATIVE	Following the World Wars, the United Nations and its members developed much of the discourse and the bodies of law that now make up international humanitarian law and international human rights law.	124	127
accept	DYNAMIC	These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in Rawls) – a social contract.	66	71
argues	STATIVE	Interest theory argues that the principal function of human rights is to protect and promote certain essential human interests, while will theory attempts to establish the validity of human rights based on the unique human capacity for freedom.	16	21
listed	DYNAMIC	David Kennedy had listed pragmatic worries and polemical charges concerning human rights in 2002 in Harvard Human Rights Journal.	18	23
classified	DYNAMIC	Human rights can be classified and organized in a number of different ways.	20	29
held	STATIVE	This is held to be true because without civil and political rights the public cannot assert their economic, social and cultural rights.	8	11
said	STATIVE	"Some human rights are said to be ""inalienable rights""."	22	25
increased	STATIVE	In the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II, there was increased concern for the social and legal protection of human rights as fundamental freedoms.	62	70
characterized	DYNAMIC	Since then, international human rights law has been characterized by a linked system of conventions, treaties, organisations, and political bodies, rather than any single entity or set of laws.	52	64
composed	STATIVE	Islam (; الإسلام, ælʔɪsˈlæːm) is a monotheistic and Abrahamic religion articulated by the Qur'an, a book considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (الله , ʔalˤˈlˤɑːh) and by the teachings and normative example (called the Sunnah and composed of hadith) of Muhammad 570 CE – 8 June 632 CE], considered by them to be the last prophet of God.	250	257
found	STATIVE	Sizable minorities are also found in Europe, China, Russia, and the Americas.	28	32
found	STATIVE	Converts and immigrant communities are found in almost every part of the world (see Islam by country).	39	43
states	DYNAMIC	"There are no intermediaries, such as clergy, to contact God who states, ""I am nearer to him than (his) jugular vein."""	64	70
made	STATIVE	Muslims believe that angels are made of light.	32	35
lit	STATIVE	The exhibition included exhibits of his inventions, and the city was lit with electric light, thanks to Swan's invention.	69	71
named	STATIVE	The house was later converted into a private fee paying, grant aided co-educational grammar school named Beaconsfield School.	99	103
allowing	STATIVE	The most significant feature of Swan's improved lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost white-hot without catching fire.	143	150
lit	STATIVE	The Savoy, a state-of-the-art theatre in the City of Westminster, London, was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electricity.	117	119
introduced	STATIVE	"The builder of the Savoy, Richard D'Oyly Carte, explained why he had introduced Swan's electric light: ""The greatest drawbacks to the enjoyment of the theatrical performances are, undoubtedly, the foul air and heat which pervade all theatres."	69	78
is	DYNAMIC	A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews.	26	27
claims	STATIVE	Judaism claims a historical continuity spanning more than 3,000 years.	8	13
estimated	DYNAMIC	In 2012, the world Jewish population was estimated at about 14 million, or roughly 0.2% of the total world population.	41	49
spread	STATIVE	About 42% of all Jews reside in Israel and about 42% reside in the United States and Canada, with most of the remainder living in Europe, and other minority groups spread throughout the world in South America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.	164	169
portrayed	STATIVE	Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people He created.	58	66
begins	STATIVE	Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of humankind.	13	18
is	DYNAMIC	Many generations later, he commanded the nation of Israel to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world.	97	99
are	DYNAMIC	He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people.	71	73
characterized	DYNAMIC	"Thus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism (Kabbalah), Rabbinic scholar Max Kadushin has characterized normative Judaism as ""normal mysticism"", because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews."	103	115
is	DYNAMIC	This is played out through the observance of the Halakha and given verbal expression in the Birkat Ha-Mizvot, the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled.	5	6
calling	STATIVE	Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the Berakhot.	113	119
records	STATIVE	The Jewish Bible (Tanakh) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in ancient Israel.	26	32
accept	STATIVE	In modern times, some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history.	54	59
form	STATIVE	The leaves and stem together form the shoot.	29	32
borne	STATIVE	Typically a leaf is a thin, dorsiventrally flattened organ, borne above ground and specialized for photosynthesis.	60	64
adapted	STATIVE	Many types of leaves are adapted in ways almost unrecognisable in those terms: some are not flat (for example many succulent leaves and the needles of conifers), some are not above ground (such as bulb scales), and some are without major photosynthetic function (consider for example cataphylls, and spines).	25	31
look	STATIVE	Conversely, many structures of non-vascular plants, and even of some lichens, which are not plants at all (in the sense of being members of the kingdom Plantae), do look and function much like leaves.	165	168
exposed	STATIVE	Typically leaves are flat and thin, thereby maximising the surface area directly exposed to light and promoting photosynthetic function.	81	87
arranged	STATIVE	They are arranged on the plant so as to expose their surfaces to light as efficiently as possible without shading each other, but there are many exceptions and complications; for instance plants adapted to windy conditions may have pendent leaves, such as in many willows and Eucalyptus.	9	16
adapted	STATIVE	Some leaf forms are adapted to modulate the amount of light they absorb to avoid or mitigate excessive heat, ultraviolet damage, or desiccation, or to sacrifice light-absorption efficiency in favour of protection from herbivory.	20	26
leaves	STATIVE	Considerable changes in leaf type occur within species too, for example as a plant matures; as a case in point Eucalyptus species commonly have isobilateral, pendent leaves when mature and dominating their neighbours; however, such trees tend to have erect or horizontal dorsiventral leaves as seedlings, when their growth is limited by the available light.	166	171
modified	STATIVE	Leaves can also store food and water, and are modified accordingly to meet these functions, for example in the leaves of succulent plants and in bulb scales.	46	53
leaves	DYNAMIC	Vascularised leaves first evolved during the Devonian period, when carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere dropped significantly.	13	18
accept	STATIVE	In left-right politics, left-wing politics are political positions or activities that accept or support social equality, often in opposition to social hierarchy and social inequality.	86	91
sat	STATIVE	In politics, the term left wing derives from the French Revolution, as the anti-monarchist Montagnard and Jacobin deputies from the Third Estate generally sat to the left of the president's chair in parliament, a habit which began in the Estates General of 1789.	155	157
called	DYNAMIC	Since the Right was populist, both in the Western and the Eastern Bloc, anything viewed as avant-garde art was called leftist in all Europe.	111	116
draws	STATIVE	Marxian economics does not exclusively rely upon Marx, it draws from a range of Marxist and non-Marxist sources.	58	62
see	STATIVE	The dictatorship of the proletariat or workers' state are terms used by Marxists to describe what they see as a temporary state between the capitalist and communist society.	103	105
divided	DYNAMIC	The political relevance of farmers has divided the left.	39	45
united	DYNAMIC	For example, the left-wing Builders Labourers Federation in Australia, led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place Green Bans on environmentally destructive development projects.	104	109
allow	STATIVE	While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind persons to read and write quickly and efficiently.	85	89
built	STATIVE	Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind.	91	95
adapted	DYNAMIC	It went unused by most educators for many years after his death, but posterity has recognized braille as a revolutionary invention, and it has been adapted for use in languages worldwide.	148	154
pressed	DYNAMIC	Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes.	37	43
survived	DYNAMIC	Louis Braille survived the torment of the infection but by the age of five he was completely blind in both eyes.	14	21
permitted	DYNAMIC	Because of his combination of intelligence and diligence, Braille was permitted to attend one of the first schools for blind children in the world, the Royal Institute for Blind Youth, since renamed to the National Institute for Blind Youth in Paris.	70	78
devoted	DYNAMIC	Not blind himself, Haüy was a committed philanthropist who devoted his life to helping the blind.	59	65
designed	DYNAMIC	He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters.	3	10
fashioned	STATIVE	So that the young Louis could send letters back home, Simon-René provided him with an alphabet fashioned from bits of thick leather.	95	103
came	STATIVE	The handcrafted Haüy books all came in uncomfortable sizes and weights.	31	34
constructed	STATIVE	They were laboriously constructed, exquisitely delicate, and greatly expensive to obtain: when Haüy's school first opened, it had a total of three books.	22	33
presented	STATIVE	To him, the books presented a new and handsome system which would be readily approved by those with eyesight.	18	26
was	DYNAMIC	By 1833, he was elevated to a full professorship.	12	14
stayed	STATIVE	For much of the rest of his life, Braille stayed at the Institute where he taught history, geometry, and algebra.	42	47
enabled	DYNAMIC	Braille's ear for music enabled him to become an accomplished cellist and organist in classes taught by Jean-Nicholas Marrigues.	24	30
held	STATIVE	A devout Catholic, Braille held the position of organist in Paris at the Church of Saint-Nicolas-des-Champs from 1834 to 1839, and later at the Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul.	27	30
identifies	STATIVE	Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity that identifies with the theology of Martin Luther , a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian.	62	71
making	STATIVE	Today, Lutheranism is one of the largest denominations of Protestantism and Christianity overall, with approximately 80 million adherents, making it the third most common Protestant denomination after historically pentecostal denominations and Anglicanism.	139	144
preferring	STATIVE	"Martin Luther always disliked the term, preferring instead to describe the reform movement with the term ""Evangelical"", which was derived from euangelion, a Greek word meaning ""good news"", i.e."	40	49
defined	DYNAMIC	"In 1597, theologians in Wittenberg defined the title ""Lutheran"" as referring to the true church."	35	41
ruling	STATIVE	Lutheranism spread through all of Scandinavia during the 16th century, as the monarch of Denmark–Norway (also ruling Iceland and the Faroe Islands) and the monarch of Sweden (also ruling Finland) adopted Lutheranism.	110	115
held	DYNAMIC	Since 1520, regular Lutheran services have been held in Copenhagen.	48	51
following	DYNAMIC	However, following his victory in the civil war that followed, in 1537 he became Christian III and advanced the Reformation in Denmark-Norway.	9	17
mention	STATIVE	It does not mention the Augsburg Confession.	12	18
entrusted	DYNAMIC	"In comparison to Catholicism, the Lutheran Church does not believe that tradition is a carrier of the ""Word of God"", and that only the communion of the Bishop of Rome had been entrusted to interpret the ""Word of God""."	176	184
supported	DYNAMIC	The pope's refusal to allow the replacement of an archbishop who had supported the invading forces opposing Gustav Vasa during the Stockholm Bloodbath led to the severing of any official connection between Sweden and the papacy in 1523.	69	77
refer	DYNAMIC	It is often used to mean this syndrome but may refer to other mood disorders or simply to a low mood.	47	51
affects	DYNAMIC	Major depressive disorder is a disabling condition that adversely affects a person's family, work or school life, sleeping and eating habits, and general health.	66	72
appears	STATIVE	Medication appears to be effective, but the effect may only be significant in the most severely depressed.	11	17
be	DYNAMIC	Current and former patients may be stigmatized.	32	33
focus	STATIVE	Most biological theories focus on the monoamine chemicals serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine, which are naturally present in the brain and assist communication between nerve cells.	25	29
named	DYNAMIC	This cluster of symptoms (syndrome) was named, described and classified as one of the mood disorders in the 1980 edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual.	40	45
been	DYNAMIC	Its impact on functioning and well-being has been compared to that of chronic medical conditions such as diabetes.	45	48
display	DYNAMIC	Depressed children may often display an irritable mood rather than a depressed mood, and show varying symptoms depending on age and situation.	29	35
suffer	STATIVE	The 1990–92 National Comorbidity Survey (US) reports that 51% of those with major depression also suffer from lifetime anxiety.	98	103
increased	STATIVE	There are increased rates of alcohol and drug abuse and particularly dependence, and around a third of individuals diagnosed with ADHD develop comorbid depression.	10	18
tuned	STATIVE	It has eight strings in four paired courses, tuned in fifths like a mandolin, but is larger, and tuned CC-GG-dd-aa (low to high in pitch).	45	49
giving	STATIVE	These instruments may have approximately 23 frets, giving the 4-course mandocello a range from two octaves below middle C to the F an octave above middle C. Bowl-back instruments may have a shorter scale length, on the order of 22.5 inches, and concert bowl-back instruments may have more frets permitting virtuoso passage work in the upper register.	51	56
termed	STATIVE	The 10-string mandocello, containing an additional course of E strings (CC-GG-dd-aa-e'e'), may be termed a liuto cantabile or liuto moderno, although these instruments remain technically mandocellos.	98	103
composed	DYNAMIC	It is occasionally used as a solo instrument for the performance of classical music, such as concertos and unaccompanied repertoire originally composed for solo cello.	143	150
featured	DYNAMIC	"One recent recording with mandolin virtuosos Carlo Aonzo and David Grisman has featured Zenkl's mandocello on the album of Italian folk music ""Traversata"" published by Acoustic Disc."	79	86
tuned	STATIVE	Steve Knightley of the English folk-rock band Show of Hands plays the cello-mandolin, however his instrument is tuned GDAD, similar to an octave mandolin.	112	116
covered	DYNAMIC	This song was later covered by Concrete Blonde and released on their album Still in Hollywood.	20	26
come	STATIVE	They come in a variety of colours, from shades of brown to bright neon colours and are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and sub-tropical marine habitats.	5	8
handled	STATIVE	"Called ""sea locusts"" by ancient Assyrians, ""prawn killers"" in Australia and now sometimes referred to as ""thumb splitters"" – because of the animal's ability to inflict painful gashes if handled incautiously – mantis shrimp sport powerful claws that they use to attack and kill prey by spearing, stunning, or dismemberment."	186	192
wait	DYNAMIC	They either wait for prey to chance upon them or, unlike most crustaceans, sometimes hunt, chase, and kill prey.	12	15
made	STATIVE	The midband region of its eye is made up of six rows of specialised ommatidia.	33	36
carry	STATIVE	Four rows carry up to 16 different photoreceptor pigments, 12 for colour sensitivity, others for colour filtering.	10	14
perceive	DYNAMIC	The vision of the mantis shrimp is so precise that it can perceive both polarised light and multispectral images.	58	65
mounted	STATIVE	Their eyes (both mounted on mobile stalks and capable of moving independently of each other) are similarly variably coloured and are considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.	17	23
made	STATIVE	Each compound eye is made up of up to ten thousand ommatidia of the apposition type.	21	24
divides	STATIVE	Each eye consists of two flattened hemispheres separated by six parallel rows of specialised ommatidia, collectively called the midband, which divides the eye into three regions.	143	149
enables	STATIVE	This configuration enables mantis shrimp to see objects with three parts of the same eye.	19	25
divided	STATIVE	The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the rhabdom is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths.	102	108
found	STATIVE	A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the dorsal and ventral hemispheres of the eye.	35	39
divided	STATIVE	In mantis shrimps the movement of the stalked eye is unusually free, and can be driven in all possible axes of movement – up to at least 70° – by eight individual eyecup muscles divided into six functional groups.	178	184
detected	DYNAMIC	By using these muscles to scan the surroundings with the midband, they can add information about forms, shapes and landscape which cannot be detected by the upper and lower hemisphere of the eye.	141	148
leading	STATIVE	The visual information leaving the retina seems to be processed into numerous parallel data streams leading into the central nervous system, greatly reducing the analytical requirements at higher levels.	100	106
yield	STATIVE	The species Gonodactylus smithii is the only organism known to simultaneously detect the four linear and two circular polarization components required to measure all four Stokes parameters, which yield a full description of polarization.	196	200
suggests	STATIVE	That those with the most advanced vision also are the species with the most colourful bodies suggests the evolution of colour vision has taken the same direction as the peacock's tail.	93	100
detected	STATIVE	During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments.	121	128
enables	DYNAMIC	It has been suggested that the capacity to see UV light enables observation of otherwise hard to detect prey on coral reefs.	56	62
depending	DYNAMIC	Also depending on the species, male and female may come together only to mate, or they may bond in monogamous long-term relationships.	5	13
look	DYNAMIC	In other species, the female will look after the eggs while the male hunts for both of them.	34	37
display	STATIVE	Although stomatopods typically display the standard locomotion types as seen in true shrimp and lobsters, one species, Nannosquilla decemspinosa, has been observed flipping itself into a crude wheel.	31	37
are	DYNAMIC	Usually they are deep fried with garlic and chili peppers.	13	15
refer	DYNAMIC	Midwives refer women to specialists such as obstetricians or perinatologists in complications related to pregnancy and birth when a pregnant woman requires care beyond the midwives' scope of practice.	9	13
recognized	STATIVE	The midwife is recognized as a responsible and accountable professional who works in partnership with women to give the necessary support, care, and advice during pregnancy, labor, and the postpartum period; to conduct births on the midwife's own responsibility; and to provide care for the infant.	15	24
is	DYNAMIC	In the term midwife, the morpheme -wife is pronounced as expected , but midwifery is normally pronounced ().	40	41
committed	STATIVE	Created in 1987 by the Midwives Alliance of North America, NARM is committed to identifying standards and practices that reflect the excellence and diversity of the independent midwifery community in order to set the standard for North American midwifery.	67	75
support	DYNAMIC	They generally support and encourage natural childbirth in all practice settings.	15	21
certified	STATIVE	A CPM is an independent professional certified by the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM) and adheres to the Midwives Model of Care.	37	45
have	DYNAMIC	CPMs have to apply for recertification every three years.	5	8
distinguished	STATIVE	The narwhal males are distinguished by a long, straight, helical tusk, which is an elongated upper left canine.	22	34
making	STATIVE	During the summer, narwhals mostly eat Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet.	107	112
suggests	STATIVE	Genetic evidence suggests the porpoises are more closely related to the white whales, and that these two families constitute a separate clade which diverged from the rest of Delphinoidea within the past 11 million years.	17	24
shows	STATIVE	Fossil evidence shows that ancient white whales lived in tropical waters.	16	20
shared	STATIVE	Both these characteristics are shared by the beluga whale.	31	36
swept	STATIVE	The tail flukes of female narwhals have front edges that are swept back, and those of males have front edges that are more concave and lack a sweep-back.	61	65
caused	STATIVE	This is thought to be an adaptation for reducing drag caused by the tusk.	54	59
forms	STATIVE	The most conspicuous characteristic of the male narwhals are their single extremely long tusk, a canine tooth that projects from the left side of the upper jaw, through the lip and forms a left-handed helix spiral.	181	185
connecting	DYNAMIC	The tusk is an innervated sensory organ with millions of patent nerve endings connecting the external ocean environment with the brain.	78	87
suggesting	STATIVE	A broken tusk was found embedded in the melon of a beluga, suggesting a fight.	59	68
running	STATIVE	Individuals are commonly recorded in the northern part of Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Baffin Bay; off the east coast of Greenland; and in a strip running east from the northern end of Greenland round to eastern Russia (170° East).	145	151
composed	STATIVE	Their prey is predominantly composed of Greenland halibut, polar and Arctic cod, cuttlefish, shrimp and armhook squid.	28	35
reduced	STATIVE	It is thought that the beaked whales, which have similarly reduced dentition, also suck up their prey.	59	65
made	STATIVE	The study found in 1978 that the Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) made up about 51% of the diet of the narwhals, with the next most common animal being the Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), consisting of 37% of the weight of their diet.	63	66
reflected	DYNAMIC	"Clicks, ""whistles"" and ""knocks"", may be created via air between chambers near the blow-hole, and reflected off the sloping front of the skull."	97	105
dealing	STATIVE	"grc -logia ""study of"") is a branch of medicine dealing with disorders of the nervous system."	47	53
focusing	STATIVE	Some neurologists receive additional subspecialty training focusing on a particular area of neurology.	59	66
employed	STATIVE	Commonly employed tests in neurology include imaging studies such as computed axial tomography (CAT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound of major blood vessels of the head and neck.	9	16
emphasizes	STATIVE	Neurosurgery is a distinct specialty that involves a different training path, and emphasizes the surgical treatment of neurological disorders.	82	91
referred	STATIVE	"In common English usage, occult refers to ""knowledge of the paranormal"", as opposed to ""knowledge of the measurable"", usually referred to as science."	126	133
kept	DYNAMIC	"The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that ""is meant only for certain people"" or that ""must be kept hidden"", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that extends beyond pure reason and the physical sciences."	103	106
describes	STATIVE	It also describes a number of magical organizations or orders, the teachings and practices taught by them, and to a large body of current and historical literature and spiritual philosophy related to this subject.	8	16
found	STATIVE	Interpretation of occultism and its concepts can be found in the belief structures of philosophies and religions such as Chaos magic, Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Theosophy, Wicca, Thelema and modern paganism.	52	56
offered	STATIVE	A broad definition is offered by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke:	22	28
conceived	STATIVE	To the occultist, occultism is conceived of as the study of the inner nature of things, as opposed to the outer characteristics that are studied by science.	31	39
suggests	DYNAMIC	"The German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer designates this ""inner nature"" with the term Will, and suggests that science and mathematics are unable to penetrate beyond the relationship between one thing and another in order to explain the ""inner nature"" of the thing itself, independent of any external causal relationships with other ""things""."	98	105
points	STATIVE	"Schopenhauer also points towards this inherently relativistic nature of mathematics and conventional science in his formulation of the ""World as Will""."	18	23
embrace	DYNAMIC	Some religions and sects enthusiastically embrace occultism as an integral esoteric aspect of mystical religious experience.	42	48
defined	STATIVE	They may view the occult as being anything supernatural or paranormal which is not achieved by or through God (as defined by those religious denominations), and is therefore the work of an opposing and malevolent entity.	114	120
regarded	DYNAMIC	Christian authorities have generally regarded occultism as heretical whenever they met this: from early Christian times, in the form of gnosticism, to late Renaissance times, in the form of various occult philosophies.	37	44
goes	STATIVE	Though there is a Christian occult tradition that goes back at least to Renaissance times, when Marsilio Ficino developed a Christian Hermeticism and Pico della Mirandola developed a Christian form of Kabbalism, mainstream Christianity has always resisted occult influences, which are:	50	53
forbidden	STATIVE	* Seen as involving practices such as divination and calling on spirits which are forbidden in the Bible	82	90
form	STATIVE	Alchemy, astrology, herbalism, yogic practices, sex magic, and trance also together form the multifaceted and multilevel nature of Tantra.	84	87
representing	STATIVE	The Atharva Veda, representing an independent tradition markedly different from the other three Vedas, is a rich source parallel to the Vedic traditions of the Rig, Sam, and Yajur Vedas, containing detailed descriptions of various kinds of magical rituals for different results ranging from punishing enemies, to acquisition of wealth, health, long life, or a good harvest.	18	29
making	STATIVE	Okapis have reddish dark backs, with striking horizontal white stripes on the front and back legs, making them resemble zebras from a distance.	99	104
pointed	STATIVE	This sticky tongue is pointed and bluish-grey in colour like that of the giraffe.	22	28
caused	STATIVE	This lack of territory is caused by human land development and other limiting social factors.	26	31
allows	DYNAMIC	The male is protective of his territory, but allows females to pass through the domain to forage.	45	50
are	DYNAMIC	They are most commonly found in the Wamba and Epulu areas.	5	7
indicate	DYNAMIC	Field observations indicate their mineral and salt requirements are filled primarily by a sulfurous, slightly salty, reddish clay found near rivers and streams.	19	26
depicted	STATIVE	Although the okapi was unknown to the Western world until the 20th century, it may have been depicted since the early fifth century BCE on the façade of the Apadana at Persepolis, a gift from the Ethiopian procession to the Achaemenid kingdom.	93	100
expected	DYNAMIC	Johnston was puzzled by the okapi tracks the natives showed him; while he had expected to be on the trail of some sort of forest-dwelling horse, the tracks were of a cloven-hoofed beast.	78	85
classified	DYNAMIC	From this skull, the okapi was correctly classified as a relative of the giraffe; in 1901, the species was formally recognized as Okapia johnstoni.	41	50
directs	DYNAMIC	The Brookfield Zoo directs the Okapi Species Survival Plan (SSP) for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.	19	25
classified	STATIVE	Okapis are classified as endangered since 2013; they are endangered by habitat destruction and poaching.	11	20
estimated	STATIVE	The world population is estimated at 10,000.	24	32
threatened	DYNAMIC	The Congo Civil War threatened both the wildlife and the conservation workers in the reserve.	20	29
managed	STATIVE	An important captive-breeding centre at Epulu, at the heart of the reserve, is managed jointly by the Congolese Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN) and Gilman International Conservation, which in turn receives support from other organisations including UNESCO, the Frankfurt Zoological Society and WildlifeDirect as well as from zoos around the world.	79	85
prepared	DYNAMIC	In the first centuries BCE and CE, papyrus scrolls gained a rival as a writing surface in the form of parchment, which was prepared from animal skins.	123	130
fashioned	DYNAMIC	Sheets of parchment were folded to form quires from which book-form codices were fashioned.	81	90
contended	STATIVE	Papyrus was replaced in Europe by the cheaper, locally produced products parchment and vellum, of significantly higher durability in moist climates, though Henri Pirenne's connection of its disappearance with the Muslim overrunning of Egypt is contended.	244	253
continued	STATIVE	Its use in Egypt continued until it was replaced by more inexpensive paper introduced by Arabs.	17	25
referring	DYNAMIC	The Greek writer Theophrastus, who flourished during the 4th century BC, uses papuros when referring to the plant used as a foodstuff and bublos for the same plant when used for nonfood products, such as cordage, basketry, or writing surfaces.	91	99
finds	STATIVE	The more specific term βίβλος biblos, which finds its way into English in such words as 'bibliography', 'bibliophile', and 'bible', refers to the inner bark of the papyrus plant.	44	48
increasing	DYNAMIC	The strips may have been soaked in water long enough for decomposition to begin, perhaps increasing adhesion, but this is not certain.	89	98
is	DYNAMIC	After drying, the sheet is polished with some rounded object, possibly a stone or seashell or round hardwood.	24	25
attached	DYNAMIC	A wooden stick would be attached to the last sheet in a roll, making it easier to handle.	24	31
united	DYNAMIC	To form the long strip scrolls required, a number of such sheets were united, placed so all the horizontal fibres parallel with the roll's length were on one side and all the vertical fibres on the other.	70	76
following	STATIVE	Normally, texts were first written on the recto, the lines following the fibres, parallel to the long edges of the scroll.	59	67
study	DYNAMIC	Parapsychologists study telepathy, precognition, clairvoyance, psychokinesis, near-death experiences, reincarnation, apparitional experiences, and other paranormal claims.	18	22
explained	STATIVE	In parapsychology, psi is the unknown factor in extrasensory perception and psychokinesis experiences that is not explained by known physical or biological mechanisms.	114	122
divides	STATIVE	The Parapsychological Association divides psi into two main categories: psi-gamma for extrasensory perception and psi-kappa for psychokinesis.	34	40
is	DYNAMIC	The census was the Society's first attempt at a statistical evaluation of paranormal phenomena, and the resulting publication in 1886, Phantasms of the Living is still widely referenced in parapsychological literature today.	159	160
put	STATIVE	Playing cards were enclosed in envelopes and a subject put under hypnosis attempted to identify them.	55	57
continue	STATIVE	The SPR and ASPR continue research in parapsychology.	17	24
headed	STATIVE	The effort was headed by psychologist John Edgar Coover, and was supported by funds donated by Thomas Welton Stanford, brother of the university's founder.	15	20
appear	DYNAMIC	Rhine, along with associate Karl Zener, had developed a statistical system of testing for ESP that involved subjects guessing what symbol, out of five possible symbols, would appear when going through a special deck of cards designed for this purpose.	175	180
perceived	DYNAMIC	A percentage of correct guesses (or hits) significantly above 20% was perceived as higher than chance and indicative of psychic ability.	70	78
derived	DYNAMIC	Anthropologist E. Adamson Hoebel (1966) said the Aztec patolli derives from the East Indian game of pachisi., but in R. Barry Lewis of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Illinois (1988) said the similarity between the two games is due to the limitations of a board game, meaning the two games were independently derived.	329	336
controlled	DYNAMIC	The game pieces were six red and six blue pebbles and each player controlled one color.	66	75
painted	DYNAMIC	"The game mat had an ""X"" shape with squares and the design was painted on it with liquid rubber."	62	68
bet	STATIVE	The opponent would then be required to transfer ownership of one of the items being bet at this time.	84	86
marked	STATIVE	Another special area is marked by two darker triangular shapes near the end of each arm of the X.	24	29
showing	STATIVE	After a player has a game marker on the game board, the player must move one of the game markers the same number of times as there are holes showing from the toss.	141	147
shows	STATIVE	If the toss shows five holes, then the player must choose one game marker to move ten spaces.	12	16
forbade	DYNAMIC	The Spanish priests forbade the game during the Spanish conquest of Mexico and were known to have burned the hands of people caught playing the game.	20	26
studies	DYNAMIC	Philosophy of mind is a branch of philosophy that studies the nature of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.	50	56
seen	STATIVE	The mind–body problem, ie the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as one key issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body, such as how consciousness is possible and the nature of particular mental states.	80	83
traced	STATIVE	Dualism can be traced back to Plato, and the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, but it was most precisely formulated by René Descartes in the 17th century.	15	20
continues	STATIVE	Physicalists argue that only entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that mental processes will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.	176	184
adopt	STATIVE	Physicalists maintain various positions on the prospects of reducing mental properties to physical properties (many of whom adopt compatible forms of property dualism), and the ontological status of such mental properties remains unclear.	124	128
adhere	STATIVE	Neutral monists such as Ernst Mach and William James argue that events in the world can be thought of as either mental (psychological) or physical depending on the network of relationships into which they enter, and dual-aspect monists such as Spinoza adhere to the position that there is some other, neutral substance, and that both matter and mind are properties of this unknown substance.	252	257
adopt	DYNAMIC	Most modern philosophers of mind adopt either a reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.	33	37
adopt	DYNAMIC	Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position that challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.	29	33
continue	STATIVE	Modern philosophers of mind continue to ask how the subjective qualities and the intentionality of mental states and properties can be explained in naturalistic terms.	28	35
begins	STATIVE	It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical.	3	8
divided	DYNAMIC	One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance).	154	160
presents	STATIVE	Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach to the nature of the mind.	42	49
finding	STATIVE	They would almost certainly deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding the idea that there is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible.	83	89
do	STATIVE	Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not.	65	66
pressed	DYNAMIC	The strings are sounded when the keys are pressed, and silenced when the keys are released.	42	49
ending	DYNAMIC	When the key is released, a damper stops the strings' vibration, ending the sound.	65	70
classified	DYNAMIC	Although an acoustic piano has strings, it is usually classified as a percussion instrument because the strings are struck rather than plucked (as with a harpsichord or spinet); in the Hornbostel-Sachs system of instrument classification, pianos are considered chordophones.	54	63
referring	STATIVE	"The Italian musical terms piano and forte indicate ""soft"" and ""strong"" respectively, in this context referring to the variations in sound volume the instrument produces in response to a pianist's touch on the keys: the greater the velocity of a key press, the greater the force of the hammer hitting the strings, and the louder the sound of the note produced."	101	109
remains	DYNAMIC	Cristofori's great success was solving, with no prior example, the fundamental mechanical problem of piano design: the hammer must strike the string, but not remain in contact with it (as a tangent remains in contact with a clavichord string) because this would damp the sound.	198	204
approve	DYNAMIC	Bach did approve of a later instrument he saw in 1747, and even served as an agent in selling Silbermann's pianos.	9	15
composed	DYNAMIC	It was for such instruments that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart composed his concertos and sonatas, and replicas of them are built today for use in authentic-instrument performance of his music.	57	64
found	STATIVE	or more octaves found on modern pianos.	16	20
called	DYNAMIC	"The last Pintupi to leave their traditional lifestyle in the desert, in 1984, are a group known as the Pintupi Nine, also sometimes called the ""lost tribe""."	132	137
located	DYNAMIC	A number of trips were made to the area and Aboriginal people were located and moved (or encouraged to move) in to one of the settlements on the eastern fringe of the desert, such as Haasts Bluff, Hermannsburg and Papunya.	67	73
do	STATIVE	Many political parties have an ideological core, but some do not, and many represent very different ideologies than they did when first founded.	58	59
originating	STATIVE	"The Whigs supported Protestant constitutional monarchy against absolute rule and the Tories, originating in the Royalist (or ""Cavalier"") faction of the English Civil War, were conservative royalist supporters of a strong monarchy as a counterbalance to the republican tendencies of Whigs were the dominant political faction for most of the first half of the 18th century; they supported the Hanoverian succession of 1715 against the Jacobite supporters of the deposed Roman Catholic Stuart dynasty and were able to purge Tory politicians from important government positions after the failed Jacobite rising of 1715."	93	103
wore	DYNAMIC	As the century wore on, the factions slowly began to adopt more coherent political tendencies as the interests of their power bases began to diverge.	15	18
retained	DYNAMIC	Although the Tories were dismissed from office for half a century, for most of this period (at first under the leadership of Sir William Wyndham), the Tories retained party cohesion, with occasional hopes of regaining office, particularly at the accession of George II (1727) and the downfall of the ministry of Sir Robert Walpole in 1742.	158	165
referring	DYNAMIC	"When they lost power, the old Whig leadership dissolved into a decade of factional chaos with distinct ""Grenvillite"", ""Bedfordite"", ""Rockinghamite"", and ""Chathamite"" factions successively in power, and all referring to themselves as ""Whigs""."	206	214
led	STATIVE	The new government, led by the radical politician Charles James Fox in coalition with Lord North, was soon brought down and replaced by William Pitt the Younger in 1783.	20	22
campaigning	DYNAMIC	The Home Rule League Party, campaigning for Home Rule for Ireland in the British Parliament was fundamentally changed by the great Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s.	28	38
having	DYNAMIC	He graduated from high school in 1862, having excelled in science and maths.	39	44
form	DYNAMIC	This would eventually form the basis of his dissertation.	22	25
following	DYNAMIC	After his graduation in 1866, he worked as a surgeon in the Franco-Prussian War, and following his service, worked as a physician in Wollstein (now Wolsztyn, Poland).	85	93
supporting	DYNAMIC	Koch’s work with anthrax is notable in that he was the first to link a specific microorganism with a specific disease, rejecting the idea of spontaneous generation and supporting the germ theory of disease.	168	177
outlined	DYNAMIC	These postulates, which not only outlined a method for linking cause and effect of an infectious disease but also established the significance of laboratory culture of infectious agents, are listed here:	33	40
be	DYNAMIC	The organism must be isolated from the inoculated animal and must be identified as the same original organism first isolated from the originally diseased host.	18	19
appears	DYNAMIC	The Rummy principle of drawing and discarding with a view to melding appears in Chinese card games at least in the early 19th century and perhaps as early as the 18th century and is, in fact, the essence of Mah-jong.	69	75
set	STATIVE	A set consists of at least three cards of the same rank and a run consists of at least three consecutive cards of the same suit.	2	4
shuffled	STATIVE	There are, for example, games that use five standard decks plus some jokers shuffled together.	76	83
obliged	STATIVE	The winner is obliged to deal when a new game commences.	14	20
played	STATIVE	In Rummy the number of cards dealt varies based on the type of rummy game being played as well as the number of players.	80	85
places	DYNAMIC	The dealer flips one card to and places it next to the pile to begin the game.	33	38
placed	STATIVE	The first person to go takes a card from the deck or the card placed beside it.	62	67
allow	DYNAMIC	In some games everyone can make melds at this phase, and some games allow a player to end a hand with a few unmatched cards in their hand.	68	72
found	STATIVE	They all share a common set of features found in the basic game.	40	44
has	DYNAMIC	When a player picks up more than one card, they must use the first card and has to play that card or else play is incomplete.	76	78
round	DYNAMIC	If players tie then the player who was leading before that round wins.	59	63
is	DYNAMIC	The player on the dealer's right cuts (this is optional).	44	45
forms	DYNAMIC	This forms the stock pile.	5	9
lay	DYNAMIC	The player may then meld or lay off, which are both optional, before discarding.	28	30
allow	STATIVE	Aces can be played as high or low but not both, for example and are legal, but not (some variations allow this type of run).	100	104
continuing	DYNAMIC	For example: if another player had a sequence consisting of in front of them, the player would be able to add the , or , and so on, thereby continuing the sequence.	140	149
allow	STATIVE	Some variations allow players to play the and wrap around.	16	20
makes	STATIVE	Playing with this rule makes ending a hand slightly more difficult.	23	27
left	STATIVE	For example, if a player has only the 7 of diamonds and 8 of diamonds left in their hand, and they draw the 9 of diamonds (forming a sequence), then whether they win the hand or not depends on if they are playing the discard rule variation.	70	73
have	DYNAMIC	If they are playing this variation, they can not win the hand at this point, because they have to finish the turn by discarding one of the three cards in their hand, causing them to no longer have a sequence.	90	93
lay	DYNAMIC	And a player can lay down cards afterwards.	17	19
wait	DYNAMIC	Each player must wait until their second turn to go out.	17	20
count	DYNAMIC	After a player goes out, the hand ends, and the players count up their cards.	56	60
classified	DYNAMIC	The shoebill was only classified in the 19th century when some skins were brought to Europe.	22	31
retained	STATIVE	"Traditionally allied with the storks (Ciconiiformes), it was retained there in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy which lumped a massive number of unrelated taxa into their ""Ciconiiformes""."	61	68
suggests	DYNAMIC	A recent DNA study suggests they are part of the Pelecaniformes.	19	26
is	DYNAMIC	"Since cormorants and relatives are probably not actually Pelecaniformes, a solution adopted by some modern authors is to merge the ""core"" Pelecaniformes with the Ciconiiformes."	115	116
connect	STATIVE	"The shoebill and the hammerkop (Scopus umbretta) are the ""missing links"" that connect pelicans and storks, and including the pelican lineage in the Ciconiiformes expresses this more adequately than other treatments do."	78	84
allowing	STATIVE	All that is known of Eremopezus is that it was a very large, probably flightless bird with a flexible foot, allowing it to handle either vegetation or prey.	108	115
ranged	STATIVE	Weight has reportedly ranged from 4 to 7 kg (8.8 to 15.4 lb).	22	27
help	STATIVE	The sharp edges in the mandibles help the shoebill to decapitate their prey and also to discard any vegetation after prey has been caught.	33	36
ending	STATIVE	As in the pelicans, the upper mandible is strongly keeled, ending in a sharp nail.	59	64
held	STATIVE	Its wings are held flat while soaring and, as in the pelicans and the storks of the genus Leptoptilos, the shoebill flies with its neck retracted.	14	17
presents	STATIVE	The breast presents some elongated feathers, which have dark shafts.	11	18
compared	DYNAMIC	Under poor viewing conditions, its size and wingspan compared to other birds in its habitat can identify it.	53	60
extend	STATIVE	Its legs, roughly the length of storks, extend straight back far past its tail when in flight.	40	45
distributed	STATIVE	The shoebill is distributed in freshwater swamps of central tropical Africa, from southern Sudan through parts of eastern Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and western Tanzania.	16	26
attracted	DYNAMIC	Although their distribution largely seems to correspond with the distribution of papyrus in central Africa, the species seems to avoid pure papyrus swamps and is often attracted to areas with mixed vegetation.	168	176
noted	STATIVE	"The shoebill is noted for its slow movements and tendency to remain still for long periods, resulting in repeated descriptions of the species as ""statue-like""."	16	20
making	STATIVE	Exceptionally for a bird this large, the shoebill often stands and perches on floating vegetation, making them appear somewhat like a giant jacana, although the similarly-sized and occasionally sympatric Goliath heron (Ardea goliath) is also known to stand on aquatic vegetation.	99	104
assured	STATIVE	Shoebills are largely piscivorous but are assured predators of a considerable range of wetland vertebrates.	42	48
occur	STATIVE	Nests typically occur at less than three nests per square kilometre, unlike herons, cormorants, pelicans and storks which predominantly nest in colonies.	16	20
made	STATIVE	Both the nest and platform are made of aquatic vegetation.	31	34
runs	STATIVE	Most often, proponents of a single-party state argue that the existence of separate parties runs counter to national unity.	92	95
allow	DYNAMIC	Others may allow non-party members to run for legislative seats, as was the case with Taiwan's Tangwai movement in the 1970s and 1980s.	11	15
referred	STATIVE	For example, in reference to the Soviet Union, the Party meant the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; in reference to the former People's Republic of Poland it referred to the Polish United Workers' Party.	162	169
seeing	STATIVE	"However, such states do not use that term themselves, seeing communism as a phase to develop after the full maturation of socialism, and instead often use the titles of ""people's republic"", ""socialist republic"", or ""democratic republic""."	54	59
permitted	STATIVE	One peculiar example is Cuba, where the role of the Communist Party is enshrined in the constitution, and no party is permitted to campaign or run candidates for election, including the Communist party.	118	126
dominated	DYNAMIC	The True Whig Party of Liberia is considered the founder of the first single-party state in the world, as despite opposition parties never being outlawed, it completely dominated Liberian politics from 1878 until 1980.	169	177
conceived	DYNAMIC	The party was conceived by the original Black American settlers and their descendants who referred to themselves as Americo-Liberians.	14	22
classified	STATIVE	Sloths (/ˈsloʊθ/ SLOH-th, /ˈslɒθ/ SLO-th)[2] are medium-sized mammals belonging to the families Megalonychidae (two-toed sloth) and Bradypodidae (three-toed sloth), classified into six species.	165	174
named	STATIVE	"Extant sloths are arboreal (tree-dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America, and are known for being slow-moving, and hence named ""sloths""."	145	149
make	STATIVE	Sloths make a good habitat for other organisms, and a single sloth may be home to moths, beetles, cockroaches, ciliates, fungi, and algae.	7	10
called	DYNAMIC	The sloth's taxonomic suborder is Folivora, sometimes also called Phyllophaga (Owen, 1842) or Tardigrada (Latham and Davies, 1795).	59	64
classified	STATIVE	Sloths are classified as folivores, as the bulk of their diets consist of buds, tender shoots, and leaves, mainly of Cecropia trees.	11	20
documented	DYNAMIC	Some two-toed sloths have been documented as eating insects, small reptiles, and birds as a small supplement to their diets.	31	40
documented	DYNAMIC	Linnaeus's two-toed sloth has recently been documented eating human faeces from open latrines.	44	53
take	STATIVE	As much as two-thirds of a well-fed sloth's body weight consists of the contents of its stomach, and the digestive process can take a month or more to complete.	127	130
estimated	DYNAMIC	On Barro Colorado Island in Panama, sloths have been estimated to comprise 70% of the biomass of arboreal mammals.	53	61
pose	DYNAMIC	Despite sloths' apparent defenselessness, predators do not pose special problems: sloths blend in with the trees and, moving only slowly, do not attract attention.	59	62
held	STATIVE	Their claws also provide a further unexpected deterrent to human hunters; when hanging upside-down in a tree, they are held in place by the claws themselves and often do not fall down even if shot from below.	119	122
make	STATIVE	Despite their adaptation to living in trees, sloths (like many other rainforest animals) make competent swimmers.	89	92
evidenced	STATIVE	This is likely to have been true of the extinct ground sloths, as well, as evidenced by the fact that megalonychid sloths were able to colonise the Antilles by the Oligocene, and that the megalonychid Pliometanastes and the mylodontid Thinobadistes were able to colonise North America about 9 million years ago, well before the existence of the Isthmus of Panama.	75	83
sleeping	DYNAMIC	Sloths were thought to be among the most somnolent animals, sleeping from 15 to 18 hours each day.	60	67
covering	DYNAMIC	Sloths go to the ground to urinate and defecate about once a week, digging a hole and covering it afterwards.	86	93
cling	DYNAMIC	Infant sloths normally cling to their mothers' fur, but occasionally fall off.	23	27
built	STATIVE	Sloths are very sturdily built and rarely die from a fall.	25	29
prove	STATIVE	In some cases, they die from a fall indirectly because the mothers prove unwilling to leave the safety of the trees to retrieve the young.	67	71
suggests	STATIVE	However, their adaptations belie the actual relationships of the living sloth genera, which are more distant from each other than their outward similarity suggests.	155	163
make	STATIVE	Rather, they make up a number of lineages, and as far as is known, until the Holocene, most sloths were in fact ground-dwellers.	13	16
suggests	STATIVE	Much evidence suggests human hunting contributed to the extinction of the American megafauna, like that of far northern Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and Madagascar.	14	21
points	STATIVE	However, the survival of ground sloths on the Antilles until about 5000 years ago (after these islands were finally settled by humans), long after they had died out on the mainland, points toward human activities as the agency of extinction.	182	187
adapted	DYNAMIC	In Peru and Chile, sloths of the genus Thalassocnus adapted to a coastal marine lifestyle beginning in the late Miocene.	52	58
cares	DYNAMIC	"In Costa Rica, the Aviarios Sloth Sanctuary cares for ""wounded and abandoned sloths."	44	48
making	STATIVE	It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries, making it the world's most popular sport.	59	64
codified	DYNAMIC	The Laws of the Game were originally codified in England by The Football Association in 1863.	37	44
recognised	DYNAMIC	Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA have recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.	87	96
adhere	DYNAMIC	FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.	96	101
associated	DYNAMIC	It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.	26	35
codified	DYNAMIC	The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name association football was coined to distinguish the game from the other forms of football played at the time, specifically rugby football.	39	46
appearing	DYNAMIC	"The term soccer originated in England, first appearing in the 1880s as an Oxford ""-er"" abbreviation of the word ""association""."	45	53
led	STATIVE	Each team is led by a captain who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to be involved in the coin toss prior to kick-off or penalty kicks.	13	15
specify	STATIVE	The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper, but a number of specialised roles have evolved.	28	34
keep	STATIVE	Broadly, these include three main categories: strikers, or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; defenders, who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and midfielders, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team.	225	228
permitted	STATIVE	The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted.	179	188
maintained	DYNAMIC	The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).	52	61
headed	STATIVE	"A stratocracy (from στρατός, stratos, ""army"" and κράτος, kratos, ""dominion"", ""power"") is a form of government headed by military chiefs."	110	115
inhabited	DYNAMIC	They inhabited sparsely populated areas and islands in the lower Dnieper, Don, Terek, and Ural river basins, and played an important role in the historical and cultural development of both Russia and Ukraine.	5	13
dare	DYNAMIC	No other city-state would dare to attack Sparta even though it could only muster a force of about 8000 Spartans during the zenith of its dominance.	26	29
speak	STATIVE	All three groups speak languages belonging to the Surmic branch of the Nilo-Saharan language family.	17	21
found	STATIVE	Some are also found west of Mizan Teferi.	14	18
allow	DYNAMIC	The police allow foreigners to travel there only with a hired armed guard.	11	15
wear	STATIVE	The males are often shaved bald, and frequently wear little or no clothes, even during stick fights.	48	51
have	DYNAMIC	At a young age, to beautify themselves for marriage, most women have their bottom teeth removed and their bottom lips pierced, then stretched, so as to allow insertion of a clay lip plate.	64	67
stretched	DYNAMIC	Some women have stretched their lips so as to allow plates up to sixteen inches in diameter.	16	24
wear	STATIVE	Though their chiefs (styled komaro) may wear the fur crown of a pagan priest-king, they are merely the most respected elder in a village and they can be removed.	40	43
said	STATIVE	The documents reportedly said the Surma agreed to give up their land without compensation and are being used to legalise the boundaries of the Omo National Park, which African Parks has taken over.	25	28
refusing	STATIVE	The people had been evicted but were refusing to leave the area after the African Parks Foundation signed an agreement with the government to take over management of the park.	37	44
named	STATIVE	The Suri have a sky god named Tuma.	24	28
expected	DYNAMIC	After this process, rain is expected to fall.	28	35
named	DYNAMIC	Every young male is named after their cattle, which they are ruled to look after.	20	24
have	DYNAMIC	At the point of puberty most women have their bottom teeth removed in order to get their lower lip pierced.	35	38
stretched	DYNAMIC	Once the lip is pierced, it is then stretched and a lip plate is then placed in the hole of the piercing.	36	44
says	STATIVE	One theory says lips plates were used to discourage slave owners from taking the women who had them.	11	14
refusing	DYNAMIC	In recent years, some young women are refusing to have their lips pierced.	38	45
left	STATIVE	After the skin is sliced the piece of skin left over is left to eventually scar.	43	46
held	DYNAMIC	The fights are held between Suri villages, and the fights begin with 20 to 30 people on each side.	15	18
stick	DYNAMIC	Many stick fights end within the first couple of hits.	5	9
referred	STATIVE	"During most of the 19th-century in fact, the term ""tennis"" referred to real tennis, not lawn tennis: for example, in Disraeli's novel Sybil (1845), Lord Eugene De Vere announces that he will ""go down to Hampton Court and play tennis."""	59	66
allows	DYNAMIC	A recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a point challenge system, which allows a player to contest the line call of a point.	140	145
referred	STATIVE	"The four Grand Slam tournaments (also referred to as the ""Majors"") are especially popular: the Australian Open played on hard courts, the French Open played on red clay courts, Wimbledon played on grass courts, and the US Open played also on hard courts."	38	45
had	DYNAMIC	Another of the early enthusiasts of the game was King Charles V of France, who had a court set up at the Louvre Palace.	79	81
combined	STATIVE	Between 1859 and 1865 Harry Gem and his friend Augurio Perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the Basque ball game pelota, which they played on Perera's croquet lawn in Birmingham, England, United Kingdom.	84	91
named	STATIVE	An Englishman named O.E Woodhouse won the singles title, and a silver cup worth $100, by defeating Canadian I. F. Hellmuth.	14	18
held	DYNAMIC	The U.S. National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at the Newport Casino, Newport, Rhode Island.	73	76
held	DYNAMIC	The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia.	59	62
supporting	STATIVE	In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.	73	82
serves	STATIVE	For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.	57	62
divide	DYNAMIC	Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots.	27	32
provide	STATIVE	Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants.	18	24
been	DYNAMIC	Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.	61	64
excludes	STATIVE	Such a definition excludes herbaceous trees such as bananas and papayas.	18	25
defined	DYNAMIC	Aside from structural definitions, trees are commonly defined by use.	54	60
defined	DYNAMIC	Trees may be defined as plants from which lumber can be produced.	13	19
making	STATIVE	The tree form has evolved separately in unrelated classes of plants in response to similar environmental challenges, making it a classic example of parallel evolution.	117	122
named	STATIVE	"Most angiosperm trees are eudicots, the ""true dicotyledons"", so named because the seeds contain two cotyledons or seed leaves."	64	68
allows	DYNAMIC	The vascular system of trees allows water, nutrients and other chemicals to be distributed around the plant, and without it trees would not be able to grow as large as they do.	29	34
develops	DYNAMIC	Because this growth ruptures the epidermis of the stem, woody plants also have a cork cambium that develops among the phloem.	99	106
meet	STATIVE	Tree-like plants include some palms which are not trees but herbaceous monocots that do not undergo secondary growth and never produce wood, and hence do not meet the definition of tree used in this article.	158	161
composed	STATIVE	Some of the tree ferns, order Cyatheales, have tree-like growth forms, growing up to 20 metres (66 ft), but they are structurally very different from other trees: their trunks are composed of rhizomes which grow vertically and which are covered by numerous adventitious roots.	180	187
adapted	STATIVE	Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.	27	33
serve	STATIVE	The roots of a tree serve to anchor it to the ground and gather water and nutrients to transfer to all parts of the tree, and for reproduction defense, survival, energy storage and many other purposes.	20	24
goes	STATIVE	The first root produced by a newly germinated seedling is a taproot which goes straight downwards.	74	77
link	DYNAMIC	The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another.	29	32
helps	STATIVE	The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens.	44	48
limit	DYNAMIC	It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues.	12	16
enables	STATIVE	This process enables the tree to live in low nitrogen habitats where they would otherwise be unable to thrive.	13	19
called	DYNAMIC	Researchers have discovered that certain plant hormones called cytokinins initiate root nodule formation and that this process is closely related to the mechanisms involved in mycorrhizal association.	56	61
provide	STATIVE	These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds.	52	58
serves	DYNAMIC	The requirement of redundant triggering in this mechanism serves as a safeguard against a waste of energy in trapping objects with no nutritional value.	58	63
described	STATIVE	The Venus flytrap is a small plant whose structure can be described as a rosette of four to seven leaves, which arise from a short subterranean stem that is actually a bulb-like object.	58	66
divided	DYNAMIC	Flytraps that have more than 7 leaves are colonies formed by rosettes that have divided beneath the ground.	80	86
found	STATIVE	The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes.	99	103
allow	DYNAMIC	The holes in the meshwork allow small prey to escape, presumably because the benefit that would be obtained from them would be less than the cost of digesting them.	26	30
extends	DYNAMIC	The Venus flytrap exhibits variations in petiole shape and length and whether the leaf lies flat on the ground or extends up at an angle of about 40–60 degrees.	114	120
take	STATIVE	When grown from seed, plants take around four to five years to reach maturity and will live for 20 to 30 years if cultivated in the right conditions.	29	32
gives	STATIVE	This gives Dionaea an evolutionary advantage over their ancestral sticky trap form.	5	9
deals	STATIVE	Veterinary medicine is the branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease, disorder and injury in animals.	51	55
offer	STATIVE	The Egyptian Papyrus of Kahun (1900 BCE) and Vedic literature in ancient India offer one of the first written records of veterinary medicine.	79	83
combined	DYNAMIC	"In the Middle Ages from around 475 CE, farriers combined their work in horseshoeing with the more general task of ""horse doctoring""."	48	55
stayed	DYNAMIC	"This resulted in his founding a veterinary college in Lyon in 1761, from which establishment he dispatched students to combat the disease; in a short time, the plague was stayed and the health of stock restored, through the assistance rendered to agriculture by veterinary science and art."""	171	176
called	DYNAMIC	Veterinary care is usually led by a veterinary physician (usually called a vet, veterinary surgeon or veterinarian).	66	71
registered	STATIVE	In many countries, the local nomenclature for a vet is a protected term, meaning that people without the prerequisite qualifications and/or registration are not able to use the title, and in many cases, the activities that may be undertaken by a vet (such as animal treatment or surgery) are restricted only to those people who are registered as vet.	332	341
registered	STATIVE	For instance, in the United Kingdom, as in other jurisdictions, animal treatment may only be performed by registered vets (with a few designated exceptions, such as paraveterinary workers), and it is illegal for any person who is not registered to call themselves a vet or perform any treatment.	106	115
including	DYNAMIC	Paraveterinary workers, including veterinary nurses, technicians and assistants, either assist vets in their work, or may work within their own scope of practice, depending on skills and qualifications, including in some cases, performing minor surgery.	24	32
found	STATIVE	This includes those performing roles which are also found in human medicine, such as practitioners dealing with musculoskeletal disorders, including osteopaths, chiropractors and physiotherapists.	52	56
separated	STATIVE	Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.	65	73
winning	DYNAMIC	The rally continues, with each team allowed as many as three consecutive touches, until either (1): a team makes a kill, grounding the ball on the opponent's court and winning the rally; or (2): a team commits a fault and loses the rally.	168	174
serves	DYNAMIC	The team that wins the rally is awarded a point, and serves the ball to start the next rally.	53	58
serving	DYNAMIC	* foot fault: the foot crosses over the boundary line when serving.	59	66
designed	DYNAMIC	Mintonette was designed to be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring a bit of athletic effort.	15	22
called	DYNAMIC	The first rules, written down by William G Morgan, called for a net high, a court, and any number of players.	51	56
composed	STATIVE	A match was composed of nine innings with three serves for each team in each inning, and no limit to the number of ball contacts for each team before sending the ball to the opponents’ court.	12	19
spelled	STATIVE	"After an observer, Alfred Halstead, noticed the volleying nature of the game at its first exhibition match in 1896, played at the International YMCA Training School (now called Springfield College), the game quickly became known as volleyball (it was originally spelled as two words: ""volley ball"")."	262	268
held	DYNAMIC	An international federation, the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), was founded in 1947, and the first World Championships were held in 1949 for men and 1952 for women.	141	144
managed	STATIVE	Volleyball is also a sport at the Paralympics managed by the World Organization Volleyball for Disabled.	46	52
held	DYNAMIC	In 1957, a special tournament was held at the 53rd IOC session in Sofia, Bulgaria to support such request.	34	37
included	DYNAMIC	The competition was a success, and the sport was officially included in the program for the 1964 Summer Olympics.	60	67
allowed	DYNAMIC	That year, the introduction of a new offensive skill, the backrow attack, allowed Poland to win the men's competition over the Soviets in a very tight five-set match.	74	80
winning	DYNAMIC	A men's bronze medalist in 1996, Serbia and Montenegro (playing in 1996 and 2000 as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) beat Russia in the gold medal match in 2000, winning their first gold medal ever.	165	171
divided	STATIVE	A volleyball court is 18 m (59 ft) long and 9 m (29.5 ft) wide, divided into 9 m × 9 m halves by a one-meter (40-inch) wide net.	64	70
recommended	STATIVE	The minimum height clearance for indoor volleyball courts is 7 m (23 ft), although a clearance of 8 m (26 ft) is recommended.	113	124
divided	STATIVE	"These are in turn divided into 3 areas each: these are numbered as follows, starting from area ""1"", which is the position of the serving player:"	18	24
using	STATIVE	These contacts usually consist first of the bump or pass so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards the player designated as the setter; second of the set (usually an over-hand pass using wrists to push finger-tips at the ball) by the setter so that the ball's trajectory is aimed towards a spot where one of the players designated as an attacker can hit it, and third by the attacker who spikes (jumping, raising one arm above the head and hitting the ball so it will move quickly down to the ground on the opponent's court) to return the ball over the net.	186	190
said	STATIVE	The team with possession of the ball that is trying to attack the ball as described is said to be on offense.	87	90
jump	DYNAMIC	The team on defense attempts to prevent the attacker from directing the ball into their court: players at the net jump and reach above the top (and if possible, across the plane) of the net to block the attacked ball.	114	117
gone	DYNAMIC	Players may travel well outside the court to play a ball that has gone over a sideline or end-line in the air.	66	69
specified	STATIVE	There are a large number of other errors specified in the rules, although most of them are infrequent occurrences.	41	49
jump	STATIVE	These errors include back-row or libero players spiking the ball or blocking (back-row players may spike the ball if they jump from behind the attack line), players not being in the correct position when the ball is served, attacking the serve in the front court and above the height of the net, using another player as a source of support to reach the ball, stepping over the back boundary line when serving, taking more than 8 seconds to serve, or playing the ball when it is above the opponent's court.	122	125
lasted	DYNAMIC	The popularity lasted through the 1940s, but by the 1950s it became rare to hear yodeling in Country or Western music.	15	20
described	STATIVE	"The earliest record of a yodel is in 1545, where it is described as ""the call of a cowherd from Appenzell""."	55	63
takes	STATIVE	In Georgian traditional music, yodeling takes the form of krimanchuli technique, and is used as a top part in three/four part polyphony.	40	44
explains	DYNAMIC	Bart Plantenga, author of Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo: The Secret History of Yodeling Around the World, explains the technique:	93	100
Come	STATIVE	In 1853, Christy's Minstrels burlesqued (mocked) the Hutchinson Family singing 'We Come from the Hills with Tyrolean Echo'.	83	86
listed	DYNAMIC	Recordings of yodelers were made in 1892 and in 1920 the Victor recording company listed 17 yodels in their catalogue, many of them by George Watson, the most successful yodeler of the time.	82	87
combined	DYNAMIC	Sleep Baby Sleep was also the first song ever recorded by Jimmie Rodgers (at the Bristol sessions); Rodgers would eventually come to be known as the father of both country music and American yodeling when he combined the yodel with southern African-American blues.	208	215
derived	DYNAMIC	"A possibility is the word derived from ""Yaqui,"" meaning ""younger relative."""	26	32
separated	DYNAMIC	Linguists believe that Yuqui people may have separated from the Siriono people in the 17th century.	45	53
united	STATIVE	Zebras (/ˈzɛbrə/ ZEB-rə or /ˈziːbrə/ ZEE-brə)[1] are several species of African equids (horse family) united by their distinctive black and white stripes.	102	107
come	STATIVE	Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual.	14	17
make	STATIVE	The unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people.	29	32
had	DYNAMIC	However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction.	44	46
said	STATIVE	"The name ""zebra"" in English dates back to c.1600, from Italian zebra, perhaps from Portuguese, which in turn is said to be Congolese (as stated in the Oxford English Dictionary)."	112	115
retained	DYNAMIC	This means either that striped equids evolved more than once, or that common ancestors of zebras and asses were striped and only zebras retained the stripes.	136	143
named	DYNAMIC	It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens.	7	11
tends	STATIVE	The mountain zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains Zebra.	53	57
making	STATIVE	Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head, making it appear rather mule-like.	76	81
classified	STATIVE	Grévy's zebra is the rarest species, and is classified as endangered.	44	53
occur	STATIVE	In certain regions of Kenya, plains zebras and Grévy's Zebra coexist, and fertile hybrids occur.	90	95
shows	STATIVE	Embryological evidence, however, shows that the animal's background color is black and the white stripes and bellies are additions.	33	37
making	STATIVE	When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side, making it more difficult for the predator.	53	58
see	STATIVE	It is believed that they can see in color.	29	31
giving	STATIVE	Like most ungulates, the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view.	70	75
